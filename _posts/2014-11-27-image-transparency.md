I hate transparency in images.  More accurately, I hate having to make it happen -- I think it is a fine concept.

Turns out that Preview on the Mac handles this.  From [http://scripting.com/2014/11/27/aHiddenMacPaintProgram.html](http://scripting.com/2014/11/27/aHiddenMacPaintProgram.html) ...

* Copy an image to the clipboard.
* Launch Preview.app.
* Choose New from Clipboard from the File menu.
* When the image window opens, click on the toolbox icon to enable the editing features.

Things you can do:

* Resize/scale  an image.
* Make the background transparent.
* Draw an arrow on the image.
* Save as either GIF, JPG or PNG.
