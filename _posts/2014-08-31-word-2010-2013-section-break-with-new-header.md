To change page headers from one page to the next:

* First insert a section break instead of a page break.  ("Page Layout" tab of the Ribbon, look in the "Page Setup" panel.  Select "Breaks".)
* Then double-click in the header to open the header.
* Then select the Design tab in the Ribbon.
* Then toggle "Link to Previous" to make headers independent/same-as-previous.
