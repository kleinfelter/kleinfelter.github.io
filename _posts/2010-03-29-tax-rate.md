What would you guess is the average federal income tax rate in the USA?  20%?  30%?  50%?

What would you say would be a good target tax rate?  Would 20% be a fair price to pay for:
<ul>
<li>The interstate highway system
<li>Airports and the air traffic control system which prevents (most) planes from smashing into each other
<li>Armed forces, including Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard
<li>Not having the elderly begging for alms in the streets (i.e. Social Security)
<li>Someone to foot the bill when your elderly mother needs heart surgery
<li>Not having to step over diseased beggars in the streets (i.e. Medicaid)
</ul>

If we could get all that for a 20% income tax rate, that sounds like a fair deal, right?  Wouldn't it be great if you income tax rate were 20%?

Except that the average federal tax rate <em>for people with taxes to pay</em> is currently less than 13%.

That's right.  The 'Tea Party' folks are pitching a fit over the 'unfair' average tax rate (not including the people with no taxes to pay) of less than 13%.
