I had a million Notepad files open, with unsaved to-do items, meeting notes, etc.

My employer pushed a mandatory update with a mandatory reboot, while I was out of the room.  I lost all those Notepads.

Notepad++ with the auto-save plugin can be configured to restore all those not-yet-saved files.

You can make Notepad++ really replace Notepad (pervasively) by setting up Notepad++ as a *debugger* for Notepad!  See https://mysoftwarenotes.wordpress.com/2012/07/
