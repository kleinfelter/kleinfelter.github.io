You're thinking, "I'd like to use VPN, but I can't afford a Cisco AnyConnect license."  I'll walk you through setting up *free* OpenVPN software on a [$50 Raspberry Pi computer](/content/use-raspberry-pi-vpn-server).

Benefits:

* Keep your data private when using public WiFi.
* Access files and servers on your home LAN when you're away.
* Practice principles which apply to the VPN at work.  (Qualify as an 'Experienced VPN Technician!')
* Impress your friends with your technical wizardry.  ;-)

Note: I'm installing OpenVPN on a stand-alone computer; some consumer routers will run OpenVPN.  If you choose this route, you must still generate the keys and certificates, but your router will include GUI features to ease configuration.
