Delicious.  Does not taste "fishy" and is much nicer than traditional "salmon patties."  (As a kid, I hated salmon patties.) Much, much better than the frozen "Fish Paties with Spaghetti Squash" from Paleo Foods (IMHO).  

I'm thinking of trying these in mini-muffin format, so they'll thaw/warm faster in the microwave when frozen.

Stir in large mixing bowl:
<ul>
<li>2 x 15 oz cans pink salmon
<li>1/4 C Olive oil
<li>1 pound almond meal
<li>small onion, minced
</ul>
Mix in small mixing bowl:
<ul>
<li>7 eggs, beaten
<li>1/2 C mayonaise
<li>2 tsp Tabasco (result has FAINT hint of taste)
<li>1/2 tsp pepper
<li>1/2 tsp salt
</ul>
Final steps:
<ul>
<li>Dump small bowl into large, and mix.
<li>Preheat oven to 425 (ours runs 25 high, so we use 400)
<li>Grease muffin pan (solid, not liquid oil) or spray foil cups
<li>Spoon into cups, level with top
<li>Cook ~ 20 minutes, until tops are nicely toasted
<li>Cool for 5 minutes in pan
<li>Remove from pan and eat. 
</ul>
Makes 18-20 muffins.  2 muffins is a serving.
Note: I use silicone muffin pans, and these 'release' very nicely.
