title: On Dying
---

This is about dying but not about death.  It is about the word "dying":

* Dying = death (death is highly irregular, and it cuts life short)
* Dyeing = coloring (coloring with dye is not irregular)
* Dieing = cutting a shape with a die (cutting shapes is not irregular)

That's how you can remember which of dying/dyeing/dieing you want.  The irregular verb death is the irregular activity which cuts life (and the word) short.
