title: How to Enter Special Characters on a Mac Keyboard
---

My wife was chatting with someone who asserted that he could not enter a '#' because he's using a Mac.  He later refined his argument to be because he's using a British Mac and his shifted-3 is a 'Â£'.  Finally, he refined his argument to be because he couldn't be bothered to put forth the effort.

Spoiler: On British/American keyboards, use Shift-3 or Alt-3 to get # or Â£.

This led me to wonder how one enters special characters on a Mac.  I'm familiar with the system character chooser on Windows.  How does Mac do this?

### One-time setup:

* Go to 'System Preferences' and open the Keyboard applet.  Select the 'Input Sources' tab.
* Using the '+' button, add any missing items from the following list:
    * British
    * Dvorak (If you use it.  I do.)
    * U.S. 
    * Unicode Hex Input
* If you have trouble locating any of the items above, use the Search field.
* Be sure to put a checkmark in the "Show input menu in menu bar".  This will add an icon to you menu bar.
    * Be sure you know which one it is.  You can toggle the checkmark off and on to check which icon.
* This is optional, but spiffy: 
    * Select any one of the keyboards which you've added with the '+'.  Mac will display that layout to the right. Ho hum.
    * Press and hold the Shift key.  Mac will show you the shifted form of the layout.
    * Press and hold the Alt key.  Mac will show what happens if you enter the Alt form of that keystroke.
    * You can do this for any of the installed keyboard layouts.

### Using alternate keyboard layouts

One approach:

* Click the input menu in the menu bar.  (Mine says "DV" because I use Dvorak. Yours is probably the flag for your country.)
* Choose "Show Keyboard Viewer".  You'll see a keyboard image.
* Hold down Alt to see the alt form of each key.
* If you see the one you want, press it!

Another approach:  This one works for esoteric keystrokes.

* Click the input menu in the menu bar.  Choose "Show emoji and symbols".
* Browse through the menus to find the symbol you want and double-click it to 'type' that symbol.  ðŸ˜€
