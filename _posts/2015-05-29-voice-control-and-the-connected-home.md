A man signed up for the 'connected home' with voice control.  

As he was leaving his bedroom, in order to extinguish the overhead light, he said, "Lights off!"  The overhead light turned off, but a table lamp turned on.

He repeated himself:  "Lights off!"  The overhead light turned on and the table lamp turned off.

He repeated himself: "Lights off!  Off.  Off!  OFF!"

One at a time, each of his connected clothes hangers dropped its garment to the ground.

(This is not original.  I do not remember the origin.)
