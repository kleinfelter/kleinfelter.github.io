There is a perfectly good how-to at [https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md).

Once you follow that, be sure to create an empty file named "ssh" in /boot on the SD Card.  This will enable you to connect to your Pi via SSH, even if you're running a "headless" Pi with no monitor.
