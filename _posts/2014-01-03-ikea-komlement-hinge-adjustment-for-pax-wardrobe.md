Here's how the adjustments on an Ikea Komplement hinge (used on the Pax wardrobe) work.

There are 3 adjusting screws:
![Hinge image here](http://kleinfelter.com/sites/personal/files/Komplement-Hinge.png)

* The **Left/Right** screw. Tilt door from side to side.  Turn **clockwise** to move the door **away from the hinge's wall** (when the door is closed).
* The **In/Out** screw. Move door to/from back of cabinet.  Turn **clockwise** to move the door **away from the back** of the cabinet.
* The **Up/Down** screw.  There's a screw pair attaching the hinge to the wall.  There's a 3rd screw that doesn't go into holes in the wall.  It is an eccentric screw.  As you turn it, you'll notice the paired screws moving inside their holes.
    * When the **holes get bigger on top** of the screw pair, the **door moves up**.
    * When the holes get bigger on the bottom of the screw pair, the door moves down.
