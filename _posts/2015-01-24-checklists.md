I'm dropping Carbon Fin Outliner because the desktop ("Online") version doesn't have folders/tags, and I have too many lists for a linear list of all of them.  I need to manage some checklists and outlines.  Candidate applications include:

* Checkvist
* Circus Ponies Notebook
* OmniOutliner
* NeO

Thoughts:

* Notebook/Checkvist doesn't support Spotlight.  NeO and OO do.
* With Checkvist, I'd have to handle backup/exports because I'm not trusting them to stay in business for as long as I need my lists.  
    * Oh, wait.  I see a mention of "backups to the cloud" for paid users.  It might do what I want.
    * "Enable Dropbox integration to save the latest Checkvist backup (zipped OPML files) to your Dropbox folder."  That looks good.
    * If it works, there is also https://github.com/lasseebert/checkvist_backup
* If I use OmniOutliner or Notebook or NeO, I can't access it from my work PC.  NeO doesn't even have an iPad app.  None of them except Checkvist are iPhone capable.
* If I use Notebook, I could maybe use it for project management for my non-work projects, in addition to checklists.  Evernote might be better for projects because it is available via web browser.  (Evernote does not do real checklists and outlines - just indents and manual checkboxes.)
* Notebook doesn't let you attach notes to an outline item (it does let you attach a link to someplace else). OmniOutliner does. I think NeO does.  Checkvist does via the "nn" keystroke.
* NeO doc is poor.  OO and Notebook have plenty of doc and user forums.
* OO supports AppleScript.  I don't have a use case for AppleScript just now, but opens up possibilities.
    * It isn't AppleScript, but Checkvist supports:
        * Python: https://code.google.com/p/checkvist-python/
        * Python: https://github.com/ChewingPencils/checkvist-python
        * ... and you can hit it with Ruby or similar languages - http://checkvist.tumblr.com/post/187654104/openapi-javascript-ruby-example
* I really want checkboxes, and not strike-through like Checkvist does.

So what are the cases where Mac-only is a problem?

* I work from home, so I'll have access to my Mac during the work day.  If I have to go back to an office building, checklist access is the least of my problems.
* It is handy to carry around a packing-for-travel list on my iPhone.  I could print one.
* Is there a case where I'm out and about, and I need a list?  Debugging a silent SOTA activation?  CPR?  Car won't start?  Packing from a visit to return home.  

They all seem to do OPML.  In *theory*, I ought to be able to export/import to move between them.  Fidelity may be poor.

Conclusion:

* I really want the option of cross-device use.  I'll miss AppleScript.  I'll miss the eye-appeal of Notebook.  But without cross-device use, I could run into dead-in-the-water situations where I can't use the checklists.  But I won't use Checkvist without auto-backup, and that's $35 a year.  For now, I'll run with Notebook, because I own it.  If it stops working for me, I'll look at why, and see which of the other solutions would address the gap.
