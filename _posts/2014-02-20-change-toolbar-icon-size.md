I have toolbars on my Windows Taskbar.  It is easy to change the icon size on the Taskbar via right-click on the Taskbar, select Properties, and set/clear "Use small icons."

But I can never remember how to change the size of icons in a Toolbar which I have added to the Taskbar.  To do that:

* Turn off "Lock the Taskbar" via right-click on the Taskbar.
* Right-click on the Name of your Toolbar and choose View.
* Choose "Large Icons" or "Small Icons" on that sub-menu.
