Update: 2013.06.28<br />
My life has sub-projects.  Nirvana and Things don't.  It has become a problem.  I'm not interested in simulating sub-projects with tags.  (It gets awkward fast.)  <br />OmniFocus has sub-projects, but it doesn't have tags.  That's a problem because I want to tag some of my tasks with my boss's name or his boss's name or HIS boss's name.  I need to be able to find all the thing's that an executive has put on my plate, for when I talk with him.  This is not a single-context solution, because I'm not going to *work* on the item in the exec context -- I'm going to work on it in some other context and I have to *report* on it in the exec context. <br />&nbsp;<br />
I have to be able to have either tags or multiple contexts.  OmniFocus can't do that (but I have a hack for that below).  I have to be able to have sub-projects.  Things and Nirvana can't do that. MyLifeOrganized does multiple contexts (which works like tags) and subprojects.<br /> &nbsp; <br />
To hack OmniFocus to simulate tags, enter a unique string, either in the task text or in the task note.  In my case, I could use "[tom]" or "[richard]" or "[bill]" (or I could use "[executive]").  I can use OmniFocus search to search for these, and I can create OmniFocus perspectives to display all exec tasks.<br /> &nbsp; <br />
Or I could use MyLifeOrganized (but it doesn't do AppleScript).  And it is ugly (IMHO).  And it doesn't work real elegantly with a Mac keyboard because it likes Insert.

I've been using <b>Nirvana</b> (2 - beta).  It works well for me with some exceptions:
<ul>
<li>I'd like to see Areas in the sidebar, similar to Things.
<li>I'd like to have Folders, similar to OmniFocus. (This would make Areas irrelevant.)
<li>I'd like to have an AppleScript API.  (I've cobbled together a quick-add AppleScript for Nirvana.)
<li>Uh... When are they going to start charging for it.  Free isn't a long term business model.
</ul>

Turning things around, Cultured Code's <b>Things</b> looks good except:
<ul>
<li>I'd like to see tag clouds or to make the tags window capable of filtering based on selected tags similar to Nirvana.  (Global search-by-tag, by picking the tag, not entering it in the search window.)
<li>I'd like to have Folders, similar to OmniFocus.
<li>The length of time they took to release cloud sync leaves me concerned for their long-term viability.
</ul>

<b>OmniFocus</b> has these shortcomings:
<ul>
<li>For Mac+iPhone+iPad it is mighty expensive.
<li>Some people say it is too complex.  I need to evaluate that for myself.
</ul>

Some givens:
<ul>
<li>I'm going to use a GUI (i.e. not todo.txt)
<li>I'm going to use it on my Mac and my iPhone
<li>I have to be able to get my data out of it and into another tool at some point in the future.
</ul>
