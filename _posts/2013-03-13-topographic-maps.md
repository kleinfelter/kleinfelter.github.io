Here's where I capture my (evolving) thoughts on topographic maps.

I'm making lots of hiking trips into the north Georgia mountains lately.  Many of these trips include travel on obscure dirt roads, trails, and bushwhacking.  Consequently, I'm making use of lots of maps. 

Some options:

* [USGS quadrangles](http://store.usgs.gov/b2c_usgs/usgs/maplocator/(xcm=r3standardpitrex_prd&layout=6_1_61_48&uiarea=2&ctype=areaDetails&carea=%24ROOT)/.do)
* Forest Service Road and Boundary Maps (FSTopo7.5" Quad Maps) - http://fsgeodata.fs.fed.us/index.php
* [Google Earth](http://www.google.com/earth/index.html)
* http://caltopo.com/ -- this integrates Google Maps, USFS, and USGS topos.  The USFS maps include trail data not available on USGS.
* Delorme Topo 9 or 10
* Garmin Basecamp
* Garmin eTrex 30 GPS
* [National Geographic Trail Maps on the iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trail-maps-by-national-geographic/id450588743?mt=8)
* [All Trails/National Geographic](http://AllTrails.com)
* [MappingSupport.com](http://www.mappingsupport.com/p/gmap4.php)
