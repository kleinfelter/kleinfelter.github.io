Sen. Charles Grassley (R. Iowa) has said that he thinks AIG execs shouldn't be taking bonuses, and would prefer that they resign or kill themselves.

The interesting thing is, that awhile back, under the guise of "deregulation," the House and the Senate and the President... All worked together to pass legislation that made it possible for AIG to begin dealing in credit default swaps, via the Commodity Future Modernization Act of 2000.
