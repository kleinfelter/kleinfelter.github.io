OK, coach.  I think I'd like to run my own VPN, but I'm on the economy plan.  I can't afford to buy a new computer.

The [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) is nominally $35.  That will buy you a multi-core CPU, a gig of RAM, an Ethernet port, etc.  What it doesn't include is

* Disk
* Power supply
* Keyboard
* Monitor
* Case

You don't really need a keyboard or monitor for your VPN server, you'll use a Micro SD card for the disk, and the Pi uses a micro-USB power supply.  You might be able to use your cell phone charger for the power supply, but the Pi needs good power, so splurge $10 and get a really good one.

The latest Pi, an SD Card, a case and a power supply are [available in a kit for about $50](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Clear-Power-Supply/dp/B01C6EQNNK/ref=sr_1_3).
