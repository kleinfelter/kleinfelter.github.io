I found these criteria, attributed to  James Lifton.
<ul>
  <li>Dictating with whom members can communicate.
  <li>Convincing members they are a chosen people with a higher purpose.
  <li>Creating an us-versus-them mentality, whereby everything in the group is right and everything outside is wrong.
  <li>Encouraging members to share their innermost secrets and then purge whatever hinders their merging with the group.
  <li>Convincing members that their philosophical belief system is "the absolute truth".
  <li>Creating an "in" language of buzzwords and group speak which becomes a substitute for critical thinking.
  <li>Reinterpreting human experience and emotion in terms of the group's doctrine.
  <li>Reinforcing the idea that life within the group is good and worthy, and life outside evil and pointless.
</ul>
