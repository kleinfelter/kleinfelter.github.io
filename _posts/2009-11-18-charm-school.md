<p>Two women from different social strata, who hadn't seen each other for several months, ran into each other.&nbsp; Here is their dialog:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Socialite: Hello dear.&nbsp; It has been such a&nbsp;busy time.&nbsp; Last night we had dinner with the Rockefellers.</li>
    <li>Lower Strata: Fantastic!</li>
    <li>Socialite: And of course we summered at The Cape.</li>
    <li>LS: Fantastic!</li>
    <li>Socialite: We'll be spending Christmas in the Alps.</li>
    <li>LS: Fantastic!</li>
    <li>Socialite: How have you been spending your time, dear?&nbsp; [She's clearly Not Really Interested.]</li>
    <li>LS: I went to charm school.</li>
    <li>Socialite: Oh raahly.&nbsp; And what&nbsp;did you learn in charm school, dear?</li>
    <li>LS: I learned to say, &quot;Fantastic!&quot; instead of, &quot;You are so totally full of BS.&quot;</li>
  </ul>
