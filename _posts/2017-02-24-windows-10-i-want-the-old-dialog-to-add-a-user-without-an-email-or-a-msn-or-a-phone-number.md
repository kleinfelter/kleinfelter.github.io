I know how to add users to old Windows.  Microsoft changed it and made it more complicated with Windows 10.  Here's how to find the old add-user dialog.

* Start >> Run >> control userpassword2
* Press Add
* Click "Sign in without a Microsoft account (not recommended)" down at the bottom of the dialog.
