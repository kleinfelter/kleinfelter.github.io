title: 'Solved: Alexa Echo Unable to Play Tunes By Artist'
---

Alexa started offering a "station" every time I asked her to play tunes by an artist or to play a particular tune.

After a little investigation, I discovered it was one Echo impacted, out of the 5 in our home. Somehow, the one device seemed not to know we had a subscription that would permit us to request particular tunes. (I *think* it is our Prime subscription. I don't think we have a deluxe music subscription.)

Rebooting the device and checking the software for the latest version did not change its behavior.

At any rate, the solution was to deregister and re-register that Echo.  To do so:

* Browse to https://alexa.amazon.com and login, if necessary.
* Select "Settings"
* Click on that particular Echo device, from the list of devices.
* Scroll down to the "About" section and click "Deregister".
* Confirm that is what you want to do.
* Now run and fetch your phone, because Registering can only be accomplished via the Alexa app on your phone.
* Give the Echo 3 minutes to restart.  If it hasn't restarted on its own, power cycle it.
* The Alexa app on your phone should prompt you to register the "new" device. Follow the wizard as it walks you through registering.
