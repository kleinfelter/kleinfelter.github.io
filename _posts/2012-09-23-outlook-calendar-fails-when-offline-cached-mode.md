<p>Outlook Calendar used to work correctly offline. I could create new appointments while offline, and they&#39;d sync when I went back online. Then one day I started receiving this error message:</p>
<pre>
Microsoft Office Outlook
Could not save item.  The connection to Microsoft Exchange is unavailable.  Outlook must be online or connected to complete this action.</pre>
<p>I don&#39;t know why, or how to really fix it, but here&#39;s a work-around.</p>
<p>In the lower-right corner of the Outlook window, where it says &quot;Disconnected&quot; -- change that drop-down to say &quot;Work Offline&quot;.</p>
