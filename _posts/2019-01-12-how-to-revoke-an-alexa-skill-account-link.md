### Some revocation is at:

* Visit https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/homepage/
* Locat "Login with Amazon" under "Other Accounts" and click it.

### Other revocation is at:

* Visit https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/homepage/
* Locate "Apps and more" in the "Digital content and devices" grouping.  Click it.
* Note that https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/your-account/myapps/ref=mas_ya_apps may take you there with a single link.
