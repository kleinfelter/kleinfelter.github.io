If you are using Firefox in a corporate environment, and you get too many prompts for ID/password, it may be because your proxy server requires authentication for some/all sites.  To make the prompts go away:

* Tools >> Options >> Advanced >> Network >> Settings
*  Ensure 'Do not prompt for authentication if password is saved' is selected.
