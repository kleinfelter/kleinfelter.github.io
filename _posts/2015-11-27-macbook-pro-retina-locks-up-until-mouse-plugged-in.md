a.k.a. MacBook Pro Retina locks up internal keyboard and touchpad

Every now and then, my MacBook Pro Retina locks up the keyboard and the touchpad.  Plugging in a mouse and clicking somewhere recovers it.  This is reportedly due to Android File Transfer, which I do use.  I removed AFT from my auto-started applications and killed it.

If this doesn't fix it, I'm going to add a mouse jiggler to my carry kit.  (USB device that moves a mouse a few pixels every few seconds to defeat screen saver.)  Small and and easy to use recovery device.
