ScheduleWorld did not successfully get all the appointments into Google, perhaps because of different calendar models.  If you synch things enough, eventually the messed up Google appointments start showing up in Outlook.  Very bad.</p><hr width="100%" size="2" /><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Using Funambol 3.0.14</strong> </p><p><u><strong>Paradise Found:</strong></u> </p> <p>As others have blogged, it is possible to synch your Outlook Calendar folder with your Google calendar via <a href="http://www.scheduleworld.com/">ScheduleWorld</a>. ScheduleWorld uses the <a href="http://www.funambol.com/">Funambol</a> Plug-in for Outlook to deliver parts of this magic. It even works... mostly. </p> <p><u><strong>Paradise Lost:</strong></u> </p> <p>I loaded it onto my PC, did a synch, and found happiness. The next time I did a synch it croaked. Hmmm... Not good. Eventually I tracked down the problem in the source, and figured out that Funambol was having trouble using the proxy server. </p> <p><u><strong>Technical Handwaving</strong></u>: </p> <p>The code allocates a buffer large enough to hold Content-length (from the HTTP header) bytes. It then reads all available bytes into that buffer. Oops! Buffer overfun! [sic] When it runs from my home LAN, Funambol gets what it expects -- bytes read equals Content-length. When it runs at work, the proxy (or maybe a router or the ScheduleWorld server) glues a bunch of nonsense onto the content, so that there are <em>many</em> more bytes to be read than would be indicated by Content-length. </p> <p><u><strong>Paradise Found Again</strong>:</u> </p> <p>The good folks at ObjectWeb have fixed it in a new release, but that release does not yet work with ScheduleWorld. In the meantime, I&#39;ve uploaded a DLL (see link below) that works around the issue. If you&#39;re using Funambol Outlook client 3.0.14, you can un-zip and drop this DLL into C:\Program Files\Funambol\plug-ins\Funambol Outlook Plug-in, replacing the old version of the file. </p> <p><u><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></u> If you use my DLL, you agree that you are solely responsible for any consequences. I used it successfully a few times. No warranty. Your mileage may vary. </p> <p><strong>Just the Fix, Ma&#39;am</strong>: </p> <ul> <li><a href="/assets/2006/10/4/winmainclientdll.dll">Replacement winmainclientdll.dll for Funambol Outlook Client 3.0.14</a> <em><strong>might</strong></em> work for other 3.x; does NOT work well with 3.0.7 </li></ul>
