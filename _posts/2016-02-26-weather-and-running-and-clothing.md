My experience:

| Temp (F) | Wind MPH | Wind Chill | Clothing                                                          | Assessment |
| ---------:| ------------:| -----------:|:------------------------- -------------------------- |:------------------ |
| 66          | 5-10          | 65            | Sweats, T-shirt                                                 | Shorts would have been OK, except during gusts |
| 60          | 7               | 59            | Shorts, T-shirt                                                  | Adequate |
| 60          | 7               | 59            | Sweats, T-shirt                                                 | Comfortable |
| 58          | 5               | 58            | Sweats, T-shirt                                                 | OK |
| 58          | 10             | 56            | Sweats, T-shirt                                                 | Barely OK |
| 56          | 5               | 55            | Sweats, T-shirtx2                                              | A *little* too warm |
| 50          | 5               | 48            | Sweats, T-shirtx2                                              | Adequate |
| 45          | 9               | 40            | Sweats, T-shirtx2, hoodie, ski cap, cotton gloves | OK |
| 40          | 7               | 35            | Sweats, T-shirtx2, hoodie, ski cap, cotton gloves | Adequate |

* Note that T-shirtx2 = a long-sleeve T over a short-sleeve T
* Note that "Sweats" = Sweatpants

Wind chill temperature = 35.74 + 0.6215T - 35.75V (**0.16) + 0.4275TV(**0.16)

In the formula, V is in the wind speed in statute miles per hour, and T is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
