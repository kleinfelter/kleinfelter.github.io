Another place where the right wing and I agree is that we think that subsidizing someone else's healthcare is unfair.
<ul>
<li>The right wing thinks it is unfair for someone with lots of money to subsidize the healthcare of someone without lots of money.
<li>I think it is unfair for someone with little money to be charged MORE for the same healthcare than someone with lots of money.
</ul>

Not too long ago, I had some surgery.  I have health insurance.  The hospital charged about $10,000 for its part of my surgery.  (The surgeon billed separately.)  Because I have health insurance, the hospital charged $10,000.  The hospital would have charged someone without health insurance $60,000 for the same service.

It is printed right there on the bill.  It says:
<ul>
<li>Use of operating room: $60,000
<li>Billed at negotiated rate of $10,000
</ul>
'Negotiated rate' means that my health insurance has told the hospital it will pay only $10,000 for the operating room.

I'm fortunate to have a white collar job with a large corporation, so I can get health insurance.  (Since I've had surgery, I can't get an individual policy any longer.)  The poor guy who cleans the halls and bathrooms where I work can't get insurance.  

It is absolutely criminal to charge him six time more than me for the same service.

<em>End</em> the practice of the poor subsidizing healthcare for the wealthy.  If you can't see what is wrong with this practice, ask any kindergarten kid if he thinks it is a good idea to charge him $6 for a candy bar that Bill Gates can buy for $1.
