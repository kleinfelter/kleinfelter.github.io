#1 - Stop auto-updating Firefox.  It often breaks things.  Before you do an update, you want to save a backup, in case you have to roll back.
#2 - Install the new version of Firefox in parallel with the old version.
#3 - Install https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyFox/raw/master/tiddlyfox.xpi .  Install it from this location. That gets updated faster than the one on the Mozilla repository.
