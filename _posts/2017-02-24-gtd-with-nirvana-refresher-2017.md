* Tasks are *tangible* (physical, visible)
* Lists
    * Inbox
    * Next Actions (NA)
    * Waiting for
    * Projects
    * Later
    * Someday
    * Focus: Add a star to it if I really need to do it before I knock off for the day (Sat+Sun = 1 "day").
        * Tag it with "weekend" if I can't star it for today, but I want to consider starring it on Friday night.
* Calendar

-----

## Inbox: 

* Barrier to entry is low
* Process in sequence
* Actionable? Toss it, file as reference, someday/maybe it, schedule to revisit (once) OR...
    * Can i handle it in 60 seconds?  Just Do It.
    * Capture the tangible NA; if it is a stand-alone,  capture it in NA List; else capture it in a project
    * NA list should be exclusively for "do ASAP, if in context"
* Blocked?
    * Move to Waiting For and put a nag/fup date on it
* Is it a Project (multi-step)?
    * Create a project list, and capture the project's NA
* Contexts
    * Important to David Allen. Not so much to me.
    * I care about work role vs personal ("kpk") role
    * Tag actions/projects with role ("Area" in Nirvana)
* Someday List is a problem for me because it is huge.
    * Put some stuff into Later.  Higher priority?  Really committed?
    * Put the inconsequential or the lower priority or the really just "maybe" stuff into Someday.
* Don't dilute the calendar.  Only put hard commitments there.  *Will* happen at that time.

## Weekly Review - Check:
* Every project has a NA
* For every NA, will I really do it this week, time permitting?  If not, Someday it.
* Are my NAs  things I can do in one sitting?  Subdivide, if not.
* Later list:
    * Move things to NA list, if NA is true.
    * Move to "xxxx" list, if I'm not realistically committed to do it in 6 months but I don't want to give it up.
    * Move to "give it up" list if I'm giving it up.  Capture why.
* Someday list:
    * ONLY process this list once each quarter (March, June, September, December)
* What can I do with my boys for family time this week?
* Review my Read reference list
* Review my Covey Roles reference list
* Clean-up/migrate any other Reference lists.  Do they really need to be in Nirvana?
* Are there any big picture things I need to meditate on how to improve/handle?
* "recognize and excel in what really counts — and to aim for less than perfect in everything else. If you’re shocked and feel like this seems completely unfair, I’m guessing that you probably performed very well in school where perfectionism is encouraged."

## Read Reference list:

- Entertainment
- Enrichment/self-improvement
- Work (ATT or kpk work).  Move these to project or stand-alone if I'm going to get to them this week
