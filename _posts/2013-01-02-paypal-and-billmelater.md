I enabled the BillMeLater feature on PayPal, in order to get a $20 credit.  At least, that's what I thought I was doing.  It appears that BillMeLater and PayPal are two entirely separate accounts, and they appear to be two different companies, in that they have separate customer support numbers and a call center agent for one can't help with the other.

It also turns out that it is entirely too easy for a payment entered via PayPal to get sent to BillMeLater when I intended it to go to the credit card associated with my PayPal account.  Way too easy.  As in, when I place each order I specify that it should go to the credit card, and some of them go to BillMeLater anyhow.

So I went to BillMeLater's online "Contact Us" and I told them I wanted the BillMeLater feature removed from my PayPal account.  They sent me to PayPal.  (This was my clue that maybe PayPal and BillMeLater were separate companies.)

So I went to PayPal's online "Contact Us" and I told them to cancel BillMeLater.  No response.  After a few weeks, I tried again.  Still no response.

Today, I called BillMeLater, at 866-528-3733 and asked them to cancel my BillMeLater account.  "Nika" agreed to cancel my BillMeLater account.   It took a little while for her to find my account, because she needed a BillMeLater account number, and I can't get the BillMeLater or the PayPal web sites to give me this mystical number.

I hope Nika succeeds in canceling my BillMeLater account.  If not, my next step will be to send a certified letter to both PayPal and BillMeLater, directing them to cancel both my PayPal and my BillMeLater accounts.
