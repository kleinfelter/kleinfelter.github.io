I scrubbed and scrubbed at the soap scum on my bathtub.  A fingernail could get it up, but scrubbing with general purpose household cleaner got nowhere.

WD40 works pretty well.  Spray it on, scrub with a diaper.  I read on a boaters forum that there is some concern that, as a solvent, WD40 may emulsify and remove some layer of the gel coat.

Things to try next time:
* Citrus cleaner
* Borax (with soft bristle brush on the non-slip surface)

I may try [The Original Gel-Gloss Kitchen & Bath Cleaner & Polish](http://www.amazon.com/Original--Gloss-Kitchen-Cleaner-Polish/dp/B000LNQ83O) or [this repackaged edition](http://www.amazon.com/Gel-Gloss-One-Step-Cleaner-Polish/dp/B00MD213IQ/) or I might just put on a [marine wax](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-M5616-Marine-Carnauba-Blend/dp/B0000AXNLT/).
