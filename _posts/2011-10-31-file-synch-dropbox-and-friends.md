title: File Synch (Dropbox and Friends)

I'd like to use a file synch tool that supports:
<ul>
<li>IOS 4
<li>Ubuntu 11
<li>Windows XP and Windows 7
<li>Mac OS X Lion
<li>Web Browser
</ul>
In general, I want access to my files, regardless of the device I'm using.<p>
I also want:
<ul>
<li>Files on their server can't be accessed by anyone but me (including rogue employees or SNAFUs like when Dropbox dropped the requirement to login).
<li>Access to ALL of my files.
</ul>
The short form: It comes down to Dropbox convenience versus SpiderOak's security.  SpiderOak does NOT have Dropbox's Mac-like simplicity.  Dropbox doesn't have SpiderOak's "zero-knowledge" strength of data protection. Wuala stores files in a weird virtual drive.

I'm looking to *simplify*, and none of these services provides simplicity with security.  I'm going to use Dropbox and I'm not going to sync my private stuff.

If you decide to sign up for Dropbox, please use my referral link, so you get bonus storage and I get bonus storage.  <a href="http://db.tt/s9OKDAR">Click here to register for Dropbox + 250 MB extra free space.</a>

<p>Candidates include:
<ul>
<li><b>Dropbox</b>
    <ul>
    <li>They're the market leader and the 'default' choice for many.
    <li>Sync across a LAN is near-instantaneous.
    <li>Down-side is that they don't store the files securely.  Employees can decrypt.  Since the files aren't stored encrypted, when they messed up their login process, ANYONE who knew my email address could access the files.
    <li>Available on OS X, IOS, Ubuntu, Web.  The IOS version works pretty much like you'd expect.
    <li>2 GB free
    <li>50 GB for $120 per year
    </ul>
<li><b>SpiderOak</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Available on Windows, Ubuntu, Mac, IOS, Web
    <li>Versioning of files
    <li>Files stored encrypted.
    <li>You can "access" files from IOS, but it doesn't do Dropbox-like sync to IOS.
    <li>Sync takes a few minutes for trivial files.  No local-LAN sync.
    <li>2 GB free.  I started with 6 GB, due to promotions.
    <li>$100 per 100 GB per year
    </ul>
<li><b>Wuala</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Supports Windows, Linux, Mac, IOS, Web
    <li>Stored encrypted
    <li>Versioning
    <li>2 GB free.  I started with 3 by using a referral link. 
    <li>They make you enter the referral code by hand (can't paste) and it is case sensitive!
    <li>It uses FUSE on Mac to access a virtual drive.
    <li>Files in Wuala no longer exist AS FILES on your drive.  You move them to their virtual drive, and they get stored inside Wuala data stores, so if you decide to stop using Wuala (or if it stops working when you upgrade your OS), you'd best copy those files back to your normal drive beforehand.
    <li>$129 for 100 GB per year.
    </ul>
<li>MobileMe
    <ul>
    <li>Isn't ever going to really support Windows and Linux.
    </ul>
<li><b>Tonido</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Available on Windows, Ubuntu, Mac, Web
    <li>Somewhat available on IOS.
    <li>Sync will cost you $50 per year for 50 GB.  Paying a yearly license to store data on my own server galls me.
    <li>I'd be willing to consider Tonido for a one-time fee, or if they offered a free option to synch without routing through their servers.
    </ul>
<li>Sparkleshare.
    <ul>
    <li>Not available on IOS or Windows.
    <li>Web access is "roll your own."
    <li>Stores data on MY servers.
    <li>Unlimited storage quota free.
    </ul>
<li>SugarSync
    <ul>
    <li>60 GB for $100 per year.
    <li>Down-side is that they don't store the files securely.  Employees can decrypt.
    <li>Other advantages/disadvantages?
    </ul>
<li>Box.net
    <ul>
    <li>5GB limit, but 25 MB per file on the free account.  25MB covers most of my files, but I've got enough ebooks, videos, program-installs that exceed 25 MB to make this a non-simple solution.
    <li>$10 per month gets you $25 GB storage with 1 GB per file.
    <li>$45 (minimum) per month for 500 GB limit with 2 GB per file.  (Business account: $15 per user with a minimum of 3 users.)
    <li>Encrypted storage is only available on "Enterprise" accounts (mega-$).
    </ul>
</ul>
