Quicken 2014 does not include support for Healthcare Savings Accounts (HSA).  You want to set these up as:

*   Brokerage Account
*   NOT Tax-Deferred

Using Brokerage Account will let you track investments made in your HSA.

Using NOT Tax-Deferred has the disadvantage that Quicken thinks you need to pay capital gains on earnings, but if you make it tax deferred Quicken will want you to pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.  You can probably spend it all on medical expenses in your retirement, which will be tax free.  (You can withdraw the funds for any use after age 65, but you'll pay income tax on funds that are not for approved medical use.)
