There are two things you have to install -- the mod, and the code to change Minecraft to use the mod.  We'll start with the code to load the mod.

In the instructions that follow, substitute your Windows user name for 'Stanley'.  e.g. If you login with the user name 'bob', put 'bob' everywhere I put 'Stanley'.

<h4>Installing the Code to Load the Mod (The "mod-loader.")</h4>
<ul>
<li>Download http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20629262/Latest/ModLoader.zip
    <ul>
    <li>Note that this download could vanish without warning.  If it does, Google for "ModLoader Risugami".  If you find it, great.  Be aware that what you find MIGHT contain code that will erase all your files.  There's no way to tell in advance.  Good luck!  When they come out with a new version of minecraft, you'll need a new version of ModLoader.zip.  There's no telling where you'll find that.  I expect that it will NOT be the same web address as this version (but it COULD be).
    <li>Save ModLoader.zip to your desktop.
    </ul>
<li>While holding the Windows key down, press and release the E key.  This will open Windows Explorer.  (Not <b>Internet</b> Explorer -- <b>Windows</b> Explorer.)
<li>If your Windows Explerer does NOT have an Address box (a field near the top of the window labeled 'Address'), right-click on the menu or the toolbar, and click on 'Address Bar'.  This will cause an Address box to appear.
<li>Enter the following in the address bar:
    <ul>
    <li><code>D:\Documents and Settings\Stanley\Application Data\.minecraft\bin</code>
        <ul>
        <li>Pay attention -- There is a period in front of "minecraft" (and it is after the "\".)
        </ul>
    </ul>
<li>Make a copy of the file named minecraft.jar.  Put this copy someplace safe.  If you mess everything up, replace your messed up minecraft.jar with this copy and you'll un-do everything you've done.   I won't talk about this backup file any more.
<li>A jar file is just a zip file with a funny name.  A zip file is just one big file that contains many little files.  Windows doesn't know how to work with jar files, but it knows how to work with zip files, so rename minecraft.jar to minecraft.zip.  Windows gets nervous when you rename the part of a file name that follows the period, so when it asks if you are sure, tell it that you are.
<li>Open minecraft.zip.  (Click on it.  If it doesn't open, press Enter.)  You'll see all of the little files inside it.
<li>Open modloader.zip.  (Reminder: You downloaded this to your desktop.)
<li>Create a temporary folder on your disk.  (Open D:\ and create a folder there.)
<li>Copy the contents of modloader.zip (select them all and press control-C) and paste them into the temporary folder  (click white space inside the temporary folder and press control-V ).
<li>Copy the contents of the temporary folder to minecraft.zip
<li>Delete the temporary folder..
<li>Inside minecraft.zip, there MIGHT be a folder named "META-INF".  If there is, delete it.
<li>Close minecraft.zip.  (Just like you would close any other Windows Explorer window.)
<li>Rename minecraft.zip to minecraft.jar.
</ul>
<h4>Installing the Mod</h4>
<ul>
<li>Download http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?3lnbnb1hu8tcl7t to your desktop and name the file ClaySoldiersMod.zip .
    <ul>
    <li>Note that this download could vanish without warning.  If it does, go to the Minecraft forums and ask them where it went.  If you find it, great.  Be aware that what you find MIGHT contain code that will erase all your files.  There's no way to tell in advance.  Good luck!  When they come out with a new version of minecraft, you'll need a new version of ClaySoldiersMod_v_41.zip.  There's no telling where you'll find that.  I expect that it will NOT be the same web address as this version (but it COULD be).
    </ul>
<li>While holding the Windows key down, press and release the E key.  This will open Windows Explorer.  (Not <b>Internet</b> Explorer -- <b>Windows</b> Explorer.)
<li>If your Windows Explerer does NOT have an Address box (a field near the top of the window labeled 'Address'), right-click on the menu or the toolbar, and click on 'Address Bar'.  This will cause an Address box to appear.

        <li>Pay attention -- There is a period in front of "minecraft" (and it is after the "\".)
        </ul>
    </ul>

<li>Inside minecraft.zip, there MIGHT be a folder named "META-INF".  If there is, delete it.
<li>Close minecraft.zip.  (Just like you would close any other Windows Explorer window.)
<li>Rename minecraft.zip to minecraft.jar.
<li>Check to make sure you can still run Minecraft.  If you can't, replace minecraft.jar with the backup you made, and try again.
</ul>
If this doesn't work, ask for help in the Minecraft forums.  Good luck!
