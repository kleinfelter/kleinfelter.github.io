If you use Pinboard and the Pinboard extension for Safari, you might wonder how to save a Tab Set (or a "Read Later" or a Note).

There's a Pinboard toolbar button with a pushpin and a plus-sign. Pressing it quickly will save the current tab to Pinboard.  Pressing and holding it will get you a menu including

* Add to Pinboard
* Read later
* Add note
* Save Tab Set
