<p>I wanted to be able to play audio books from Audible.com in my car.&nbsp; I don't have an iPod in this car, but my car stereo does have an audio input jack.&nbsp; I have a cheap MP3 player.&nbsp; So I thought I'd load an audio book to the MP3 player, to listen to in the car.</p>
  <p>I tried using the DirectShow filter for .aa files, with multiple applications such as dbPowerAmp and GoldWave.&nbsp; It sorta worked, but some books got cut off a few minutes before the end.&nbsp; Consistently.</p>
  <p>I tried burning to a virtual CDRW from iTunes.&nbsp; NoteBurner appears to work, but since the trial version only records 3 minutes of each track, I can't tell if it too suffers from the cut off at the end of the book.&nbsp; Other virtual CDRW programs simply were rejected by iTunes and by Audible Manager (old version that had CD burning support).</p>
  <p>So I pulled out Nero 8, and burned a set of .nrg CD images.&nbsp; Then I used Nero ImageDrive to mount the CD, followed by dbPowerAmp Music Converter (dmc) to convert from the audio tracks to mp3.</p>
  <p>I could have just burned real CDs, but a 12-hour, unabridged book is a big stack of CDs.&nbsp; The nice thing about using Nero is that it will burn the whole series of virtual CDs without intervention.&nbsp; It just burns image.nrg, image1.nrg, image2.nrg, image3.nrg, etc.</p>
  <p>For the record: I purchased these audio books, and I will not &quot;share&quot; them with others.&nbsp; Shucks, I make my living by creating intellectual property -- I'm not going to be a hypocryte and steal someone else's IP.
