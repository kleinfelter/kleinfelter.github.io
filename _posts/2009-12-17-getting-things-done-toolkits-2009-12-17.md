I tend to wander from one toolkit for Getting Things Done (GTD) to another. (See http://www.kleinfelter.com/node/50 )

  
  
  <br />
  <br />Here is a partial set of my current axioms:

  
  
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>Many incomplete projects</li>
    <li>iPhone</li>
    <li>Microsoft Outlook email at work</li>
    <li>Moderate degree of 'lock-down' on client's network and computers, including don't-install policy and blocking of POP, SMTP and webmail</li>
    <li>Business-supplied laptop running Windows XP</li>
    <li>Desire not to over-fill my pockets or to carry a 'man-bag' (i.e. a purse)</li>
  </ol>
What I'd like to accomplish:

  
  
  <ol>
    <li>Easy task capture</li>
    <li>Ubiquitous access to read/write tasks even when offline</li>
    <li>Linking of tasks to projects</li>
    <li>Linking of projects to roles/values/goals</li>
    <li>Automatic back-up (incl. local stash if data in the cloud)</li>
    <li>Linked to a voice-to-task app such as Jott/Requall/Dial2Do</li>
    <li>Not too much process friction</li>
  </ol>
Why am I revisiting this topic? I just bought an iPhone and I'm thinking that things which were not possible before might be possible now.

  
  
  <br />
Some random thoughts:

  
  
  <ul>
    <li>Remember the Milk (RTM) talks to everyone (like Kermit)</li>
    <li>If it weren't for the Mac requirement, I'd probably use OmniFocus</li>
    <li>Toodledo has features that RTM doesn't. They don't support user-ordered lists.</li>
    <li>Requall has its own iPhone app, but it doesn't appear to categorize/tag. You can use &quot;Places&quot; but then you have to turn off Location awareness. It doesn't support ANY task sequencing.</li>
    <li>Location awareness in OmniFocus iPhone, ReQuall is a really cool idea</li>
    <li>My Life Organized is nice, but they don't have an iPhone app yet.</li>
    <li>Multiple iPhone apps synch with Toodledo</li>
    <li>Nozbe? $60 per year!</li>
    <li>RTM $25 per year to get iPhone app. (Their phone web UI</li>
    <li>Toodledo $0 per year. (They have a free web UI tailored to iPhone).</li>
    <li>Nozbe supports user-sequenced tasks via drag-and-drop; RTM sorts by priority or date; Todledoo sorts by a variety of fields.</li>
    <li>Near as I can tell there is no keyboard interface to Nozbe, and no way to search their help, and their wiki has nothing with the word &quot;keyboard&quot;, and no way to search their forums</li>
    <li>Vitalist has drag-and-drop task ordering, and a decent keyboard interface. Vitalist has an iPhone web version which respects task ordering but cannot change it.  They have a bona fide iPhone application (with synch) in beta. $0/50/100 per year (5/25/unlimited projects).&nbsp; If their iPhone app is good, and I can get past $100 per year, Vitalist could be good at some point in the future.
      
      
      <br /></li>
    <li>I thought about using Evernote, but you can't create a bullet on the iPhone app, and the iPhone app doesn't work offline.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Google Tasks supports multiple lists and user-controlled ordering.&nbsp; The iPhone web interface is usable (but doesn't let you change task sequence).&nbsp; You get to it via gmail.com and my employer blocks Gmail URLs, limiting its usefulness at work.</li>
    <li>Todoist supports user-sequenced tasks.   (Click the Reorder link to enable it.) 
      <br /></li>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two iPhone apps (neither by Todoist).  Update: I've been using Doings.&nbsp; I'm pretty happy with Doings, except for the absence of search.&nbsp; Doings provides very helpful and responsive support.
        <br /></li>
      <li>Todoist is clearly a one man show. 
        <br /></li>
      <li>$0 or $36 per year. 
        <br /></li>
      <li>Frankly, it looks pretty good.</li>
      <li>The main drawback is that back-up requires some hackery.&nbsp; 
        <br /></li>
      <li>Update: Another drawback -- no ability to search by text (except to backup to XML and search the XML with a text editor).
        <br /></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
