From ghacks:
  <br />
  <p>It is possible to add any printer to the Send To menu. To do this we have to open the SendTo folder which is located in <em>Documents and Settings / userprofile </em>/  if you are using Windows XP and in the <em>AppDate \ Roaming \ Microsoft \ Windows</em> folder  if you are using Windows Vista.</p>
  <p>Create a new folder in the SendTo folder and name it <code>Printers.{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D}</code>.
The icon will change to the printers icon and you can double-click it
to access all of the known printers. Drag and Drop the printer(s) into
the SendTo menu which makes them available in the right-click menu.</p>
