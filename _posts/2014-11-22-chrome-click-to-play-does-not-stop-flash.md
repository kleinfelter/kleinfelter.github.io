Q: I do not like videos to auto-play.  I use Google Chrome. I went to Settings >> Advanced Settings >> Content Settings >> Plug-ins and I set "Click to Play", but Flash videos still start automatically.  People in the library glare at me.  What can I do?

A: Follow the same path, and go one step further -- click "Disable individual plug-ins."  Find the entry for Flash and ensure that "always allowed" is NOT set.

It is somewhat curious that we find an option to ENABLE Flash even though it has otherwise been disabled, under the label "Disable individual plug-ins", but that's where it is.
