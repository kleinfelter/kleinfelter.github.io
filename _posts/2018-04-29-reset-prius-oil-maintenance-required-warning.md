title: Reset Prius Oil Maintenance Required Warning
layout: post
---

At some point, Toyota changed the oil-change interval on my 2010 Prius from 5,000 miles to 10,000 miles, but they didn't update the firmware, so it still shows "Oil Maintenance Required" after 5000.  Here's how to reset the warning:

* Power-on the car.
* Press the "Trip" button until “TRIP A” is displayed.
* Power-off the car.
* Hold the Kilometers/MPH button down (like a keyboard Shift button).
* Hold the brake pedal down.
* Hold the power-on button down until it resets.
* Release everything.
