* On the same row as the formula bar (the bar that shows what you typed into a cell, when you select that cell), there's a field on the left, which always shows the name of the cell you have selected.  (e.g. A1, on a new spreadsheet)
* This field with the name of the current cell is called the "Name Box".
* Every cell is named with its column/row name (e.g. A1) by default.
* You can give the cell a new name (in *addition* to the column/row name) by clicking in the name box and entering a name of your choosing.
