I tend to wander from one toolkit for Getting Things Done (GTD) to another. Some of the tools I've tried include:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>Outlook Tasks</li>
    <li>Outlook with the NetCentrics Add-in</li>
    <li>TiddlyWiki</li>
    <li>GTD TiddlyWiki</li>
    <li>Bonsai (outliner)</li>
    <li>Plain text files</li>
    <li>jazzmasterson's coin envelopes and index cards</li>
    <li>handwritten index cards</li>
  </ol>I hope you see a problem.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br />What seems to happen is that once my list reaches a certain size (i.e. becomes difficult to tackle), I 'clean it up' into a new system.&nbsp; This means I waste too much time in transition from one system to another.&nbsp; Ineffective.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br />I tend to have lots of projects in various states of incompletion.&nbsp; A really big, cringe-worthy pile.&nbsp; I also tend to pull the, &quot;Ohhhh.... Shiny...&quot; stunt on new tools/technologies.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br />Here is a partial set of my current axioms:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>Many incomplete projects</li>
    <li>Blackberry 8700c</li>
    <li>Microsoft Outlook email at work</li>
    <li>Moderate degree of 'lock-down' on client's network and computers, including don't-install policy and blocking of POP, SMTP and webmail</li>
    <li>Business-supplied laptop running Windows XP</li>
    <li>Desire not to over-fill my pockets or to carry a 'man-bag' (i.e. a purse)</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Update (11/15/06)</h4>At the moment, I'm carrying a TOPS Royale (item 25229) hard-cover, 3x5 lined journal ($5 at Office Depot at Perimeter Pointe). It is about the same size as the Moleskine lined 3x5 ($10 at Barnes and Noble outside Perimeter Mall).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <p>This morning, I had the urge to move back to the computer, due to difficulty in finding the things I want to get done *today*.&nbsp; I'm going to try adding a fresh 3x5 card listing the day's priority items to mark my place in the TOPS notebook. </p>
  <h4>Update (11/25/06)</h4>
  <p><strong>Bounce</strong> - I miss being able to shuffle pages. Tried a spreadsheet with tabs for Actions, Projects, Someday, and Reference. Wrote some macros to highlight Projects without Actions and Actions with misspelled projects.</p>
  <h4>Update (12/4/06)</h4>
  <p><strong>Bounce</strong> - Oops! I'm trying to stay with paper, for simplicity. Going back to index cards. Using them pretty much like I was using the 3x5 journal, but I can shuffle the pages. Carrying them in a leather Franklin-Covey 3x5 holder ($15 at Office Depot -- look near the other small-format Daytimers). The FC holder is attractive, but it is too thick for carrying just 3x5 cards, and I've got 7 must-carry cards (driver's, credit, ATM, transit, health, pharmacy, business cards) and the FC doesn't have room.</p>
  <p>Somewhere at home I have a 3x5 leather cover I ripped off a calendar. When I find it, I'll carry the index cards in it. At least it fits my shirt pocket.</p>
  <p>I'll retain the Someday worksheet in my Excel GTD workbook. I can still capture Somedays on 3x5, but I'll file them in Excel for long-term. MAYBE I could put my Projects into Excel too, with just active Actions in 3x5?</p>
  <h4>Update (12/20/06)</h4>
  <p><strong>Bounce</strong> - So I'm not actually using my index cards. I also feel like they don't really allow me to <em>organize</em> my stuff very well. Outlining seems like it would allow better organization. </p>
  <p><strong>Outlining Candidates</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Docs - really deals in HTML documents. Could make it appear as an outline, but no ability to expand/collapse outline segments. 
</li>
    <li>Microsoft Word - Put it into Outline view, and expand/collapse outline segments via the outline toolbar. 
</li>
    <li>Microsoft Excel - select the rows you want to indent; from the menu select &quot;Data/Group and Outline.&quot; 
</li>
    <li>Bonsai - specialized outliner. 

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <ul>
        <li>How to do Projects? 

          
          
          

          
          
          
          
          <ul>
            <li>Separate outline for Projects? 
</li>
            <li>Just another entry in my GTD outline? 
</li>
            <li>Put each project into a separate outline, and link from tasks to their Projects. (Note: an item can have 0 or 1 links.) This looks slick from the item-to-project link, but how can you find links to a project from items? 
</li>
            <li>Put project name in Contact field, or a custom field. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Hey! Just noticed it can associate icons with Keywords. Using Keywords for GTD contexts instead of Category could have some benefit. 
</li>
        <li>Can color text by Category. 
</li>
        <li>Has some maddening gaps. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Outlook tasks can do a simple outline-by-category 
</li>
    <li>Remember the Milk is really slick, but doesn't do outlines </li>
  </ul>I'm going to try using Bonsai: 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>
    <li>Context in Keyword 
</li>
    <li>OUTLINE (not Item) Category of Projects, with an outline per project, with links from action items to project outline </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <h4>Update (1/22/08)</h4>Used paper for a while.&nbsp; Then I stopped referring to it.&nbsp; Maybe it was because the list got too long.&nbsp; Took a look at ThinkingRock (2.0 epsilon).&nbsp; It felt too slow at first, but after using it for a while, I discovered that it can do capture and processing quick enough.&nbsp; However, the list of action items doesn't include due date, and I can't put items in the sequence I want.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br />I could use Remember the Milk, but I got sidetracked with its Twitter interface.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br />I'm thinking about going back to Bonsai, due to the flexibility in displaying the items I want in the sequence I want.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br />When work tasks come in fast and furious via email, Outlook tasks are quick capture.&nbsp; I'm going to try using Outlook Tasks again.&nbsp; Projects go into Task subfolders; I'll use Smart Folder (search) to get the top-to-bottom view of all Tasks, regardless of location in Task or sub-folder.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br />
  <h4>Update (12/13/08)</h4>I used index cards for awhile.&nbsp; One task per card.&nbsp; One project per card.&nbsp; Then work got very, very busy, and I wasn't able to keep up, and the index card stack got to be so big it was tough to carry.&nbsp; This was one of the longest stretches with a single system that I've ever had.
  
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br />I'm going back to Search Folders in Outlook.&nbsp; You can't create a Search Folder that searches for Tasks via the user-interface, but I've got a little VBA code to create search folders for my contexts.&nbsp; I wonder why I stopped using this system before?
  
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br />Search folders:
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>.All Tasks</li>
    <li>.Completed Tasks</li>
    <li>@category-names</li>
    <li>someday (category name)
      
      
      
      <br /></li>
    <li>today (category name)</li>
    <li>waiting (category name)
      
      
      
      <br /></li>
  </ul><strong>Projects
    
    
    
    
    <br /></strong>
  <br />There are at least 4 ways of handling projects in Outlook.&nbsp; There's the list-of-projects in a Note (or in a special Task); I think of this as the &quot;just like paper&quot; method.&nbsp; You can use folders within the Tasks folder for projects; this method necessitates the Search Folders, so that you can get a cross-project Next Action list. You can use Contacts as projects, linking Tasks to these Project-Contacts in order to see the tasks for a project.&nbsp; There is the Category-project (name something like [project-name-here-including-square-brace]).
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br /><strong>List-in-a-note Projects</strong>
  <br />Advantages:
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>Simplest to implement</li>
    <li>Resistant to tinkering</li>
    <li>Easy to export to Excel via copy/paste</li>
    <li>Highly resistant to Microsoft cutting features from Outlook.
      
      
      
      
      <br /></li>
  </ol>Disadvantages:
  

  
  
  
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>Can't list all tasks associated with a project.</li>
    <li>No good place to store project notes (unless you go with one Outlook Note per project, effectively making Note = Project).</li>
    <li>Extra work required to associate a Task with its project (e.g. enter project name in the Task body).</li>
    <li>No good way to convert a Task to a Project.
      
      
      
      
      <br /></li>
  </ol>Conclusion: I don't like it because of the non-linking of Tasks with their projects.
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br /><strong>Folder-as-project Projects</strong>
  <br />Advantages:
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>Easy to group all tasks with their project.</li>
    <li>Projects can have sub-projects.
      
      
      
      
      <br /></li>
  </ol>Disadvantages:
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>You have to use Search Folders created via VBA in order to list Next Actions across all projects.</li>
    <li>Hard to print a list of projects.&nbsp; (You could write VBA to export a list of folders/projects to a special Note or Task).
      
      
      
      
      <br /></li>
    <li>Hard to export to Excel.&nbsp; &nbsp; (You could write VBA to export a list of folders/projects to a special Note or Task).</li>
    <li>No good way to convert a Task to a Project. (You could write VBA.)
      
      
      
      
      <br /></li>
    <li>No good place to store project notes (unless you use a specially named task such as &quot;.readme&quot;).</li>
    <li>Highly dependent on Microsoft retaining Search Folders and VBA in Outlook.
      
      
      
      
      <br /></li>
  </ol>
  <br />Conclusion: All of the current problems can be worked around at set-up time (i.e. not cumbersome after implemented).&nbsp; It is workable.
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br /><strong>Contact Projects</strong>
  <br />Advantages:
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>Groups Tasks with their projects.</li>
    <li>Easy to export to Excel via copy/paste.</li>
    <li>Good place to keep project notes (in the Contact/Project).
      
      
      
      
      <br /></li>
  </ol>
  <br />
Disadvantages:
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>Projects can't have sub-projects. (You can actually do this with Contacts in obsolete editions of Outlook.)</li>
    <li>Dependent on future editions of Outlook continuing to allow you to associate Tasks with Contacts.</li>
    <li>Poor aesthetics unless you use a custom form.</li>
    <li>No good way to convert a Task to a Project (unless you use VBA).&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Some of the time you'll get &quot;Bla1 Bla2&quot; and other times you'll get &quot;Bla2, Bla1&quot;
      
      <br /></li>
  </ol>
Conclusion: It is workable, but the Lastname, Firstname issue is ugly.
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br /><strong>Category Projects</strong>:
  
  
  
  
  <br />Advantages:
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>Group Tasks with their projects.</li>
    <li>Highly resistant to Microsoft cutting features from Outlook.</li>
  </ol>
  <br />
Disadvantages:
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>You'll have to use VBA to export a project list to Excel.</li>
    <li>No good place to store project note.</li>
    <li>I find [project-name] aesthetically displeasing.</li>
    <li>Mixes project names with context names.
      
      
      
      
      <br /></li>
  </ol>
Conclusion: I really don't like [project-name].
  
  
  
  
  <br />
  <br /><strong>Current overall conclusions</strong>:
  
  
  
  
  <br />Contact-projects and folder-projects are both workable.&nbsp; I don't like seeing &quot;Contacts&quot; in a Task for the project link, and I really don't like the Lastname, Firstame showing up in the Contacts field of a Task.
  
  <br />
  <br />I'll use project folders, with VBA to generate a project list into a &quot;.Project List&quot; Note, VBA to switch between Task and Project, and store project notes in a &quot;.notes&quot; Task as the first folder in a project (when I *have* notes).&nbsp; Flag Next Actions.
