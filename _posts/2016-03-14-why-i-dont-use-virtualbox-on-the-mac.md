VirtualBox is an adequate VM program.  It runs Windows and Linux reasonably well.  But I'm not using it on my Mac because I can't double-click on a .docx file in OS X and have it open in Word on Windows in a VM.  Both VMware Fusion and Parallels can do this.

Yeah, I could install Office 2016 for Mac.  No, it doesn't run all of my Word and Excel VBA code, and I have a lot of complex VBA code.  (It will run some, but not all VBA.)
