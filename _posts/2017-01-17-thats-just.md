My college band director had a large ego, an iconic style of conducting, and a loud opinion.  He had a PhD, so we referred to him as "Doc."  (We *addressed* him as Doctor so-and-so.)  Here's a story we liked to tell.

A trumpet player died and went to heaven.  St. Peter was showing him around.  Off in the distance, they saw a figure conducting erratically, and shouting, "You're horrible!  Play BETTER."

"Who's that?" asked the trumpet player.

"That's just God.   He thinks he's Doc," said St. Peter.
