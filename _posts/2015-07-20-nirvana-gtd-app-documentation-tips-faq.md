* Contexts:
    * I tag things with people's name that I want to talk with them about when I'm later talking with them.  
    * The only true *contexts* I really care about are: att ("am I working?"), kpk ("am i not working"), errands (which I treat as a project because it makes Mobile search easier), and the-person-i'm-talking-with
* Sub-projects: You can turn an Action (task) into a sub-project by embedding a task list in the Notes field.  They call this an "Inline Checklist".
    * Use [dash space] or [space dash space].  Note that turning the dash into an x in edit-mode is the same as checking the checkbox in view-mode.
* There is no additional markup for Notes beyond "Inline Checklists".
* Search/filter by tag:
    * Scroll to the bottom of the left pane, so you can see the "Contexts" section.
    * Select one of the tags you want.
    * At the top of the main panel, control-click (cmd-click on Mac?) additional tags to "and" them.
    * RTFM at http://blog.nirvanahq.com/2010/03/20/finally-compound-context-filtering/
* Really search by tag:
    * Work-around: search for the value of the tag (as if it were a word in the to-do); then filter-by-tag on that tag.  Search locates any to-do with the value in the task OR in a tag; filtering limits it to just those tagged.

* Search syntax:
    * [word1 word2] - searches for tasks containing both words.
    * [in:locationName] - Does not work for projects. Only works for inbox, next, waiting, scheduled, focus, logbook, trash
