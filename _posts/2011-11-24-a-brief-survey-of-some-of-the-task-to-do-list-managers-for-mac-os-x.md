A brief survey of some of the task/to-do list managers for Mac OS X (including some web-only products)â€¦<p>
Still considering:
<ul>
<li>OmniFocus - *** Worth doing a deeper dive ***.   I can get it to show me home+any tasks at the same time. Has AppleScript support.
<li>Taskpaper - *** Worth doing a deeper dive ***
<li>The Hit List - *** Worth doing a deeper dive ***.  I can get it to show me home+any tasks at the same time.  Has AppleScript support.  Sync is $20 per year.  
<li>ThinkingRock - *** Worth doing a deeper dive ***
<li>Todo (Appigo) - *** Worth doing a deeper dive ***.  Can't show @home+@any contexts simultaneously, but CAN show @home+@any TAGS simultaneously.  Free sync via Dropbox.  No AppleScript support.  Sync is manually started.
</ul>
<p>Rejected early:
<ul>
<li>Action Method - No offline Mac app.  Web only.
<li>Actiontastic - abandonware.  No iPhone app.
<li>Anxiety - No iPhone app.
<li>Beeswax - Abandonware.  No iPhone app.
<li>Check Off - No iPhone app.
<li>Circus Ponies Notebook - Great Mac app. No iPhone app.
<li>Do It (http://www.jimmcgowan.net/) - No iPhone app.
<li> Doit (https://www.doit.im/) - Has only a "mini" version for Mac.
<li>Doomi - No iPhone app.
<li>EasyTask - Can't show both @home and @any simultaneously. Sync is manual, and iPhone sync is via WiFi only, although the Mac edition can sync with web edition every 10 minutes.  Simplistic.
<li>Enleiten - Web only.
<li>EtreTask - Abandonware. No iPhone app.
<li>Frictionless - Fails to start with OS X Lion.
<li>Goal Organizer - Web only.
<li>GTDAgenda - No Mac desktop app.  Free version of web app is too crippled.
<li>Helium -  Can't show both @home and @any simultaneously.  No search.  Has auto-sync, but it costs $5 per month.
<li>iGTD - Can't find the download.  Probably abandoned, since the developer went to work on Things.
<li>Listappy - $20.  No trial available.
<li>Nirvana - Web only.
<li>Nozbe - Web only.
<li>Remember (by Lighthead) - No iPhone support.
<li>Remember the Milk - Doesn't support moving tasks around in the list. I really want offline capability, and it relies on Google Gears which doesn't run on modern browsers.
<li>SimpleTask - No tagging or contexts.  Sync is manual, and requires action on both phone and desktop.
<li>Smartsheet - Priced unreasonably for use as a task list manager.
<li>Taskpad.jp - Web only.  I don't see a way to persist data.
<li>Taskmate - iPhone and Mac versions don't talk to each other at all.
<li>TeuxDeux - Desktop is browser-based.
<li>Things - It is very popular.  I can't see a way to search for @home or @any.  (i.e. I'm at home, and I want to see everything I could do there, including do-anywhere items too.)  Has AppleScript support.
<li>Todoist - "Mac app" is really just a SSB (site specific browser). Would have to use Web for iPhone.
<li>todoTweet - Web only.  Cute idea.  Not useful for me.
<li>Toodledo - Desktop is web only.
<li>Trimpath Next Action - Web only (with offline access).  No iPhone support.
<li>Tracks - Web only.
<li>Wrike - Not priced for use as a task manager.
<li>Wunderlist - Too simplistic.  No tags or contexts.
<li>Yojimbo - No iPhone support.
</ul>
