My iPhone calendar stopped sounding alerts for appointments.  This happened after I switched from syncing the calendar via an Exchange account to syncing via the "Gmail" account.  (This really means that I was synching to Google via the Exchange protocol and now I'm syncing via the CalDAV protocol.)  I made the change because I have two calendars with Google and I wanted to sync with them both.  Exchange will only sync to the default/primary calendar.

So I switched to the GMail/CalDAV protocol for syncing my calendar.  (I retained Exchange to sync my Contacts, because CalDAV does not sync contacts.)  And my iPhone got real quiet.

When I enabled CalDAV sync, I selected sync for two of my Google calendars (via the "Calendars" button in the Calendar app).  I did not select the "All GMail" option - I just selected the individual calendars I wanted.    Note that the alarms I wanted were indeed in the synced calendars, but the reminders just don't happen unless "All GMail" is selected.
