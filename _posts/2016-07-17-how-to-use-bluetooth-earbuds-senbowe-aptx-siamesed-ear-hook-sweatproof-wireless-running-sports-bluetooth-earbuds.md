I bought "Bluetooth Earbuds Senbow  APTX + Siamesed Ear Hook Sweatproof Wireless Running Sports Bluetooth Earbuds" from Amazon, on sale.  The instructions are marked "Bluetooth Instruction Manual S01 Bluetooth Headset".  The instructions are almost worthless.

"The BUTTON" - There is one button on the left earpiece.  I refer to it as "the BUTTON".  There are also 3 buttons mounted on the wire between the earbuds.

**Power Control**:

*   Power On = Press and hold the BUTTON until it speaks "power on".
*   Power Off = Press and hold the BUTTON until it speaks "power off".
*   Battery Report = Tap the BUTTON briefly, while the headset is on.

**Volume**:

*   Volume Up = Briefly tap (or repeatedly tap) the button closest to your left ear.  This is button is above the others, as the wire hangs down.
*   Volume Down = Briefly tap (or repeatedly top) the button farthest from your left ear.  This button is below the others, as the wire hangs down.

**Track Control**:

*   Start of Track = Press and Hold the Volume Up button.
*   Previous Track = do Start of Track twice, with no delay in between.
*   Next Track = Press and Hold the Volume Down button.
*   Pause = Briefly tap the middle button on the wire.

**Management**:

*   Pair = From the power off state, press and hold the BUTTON until it says it is pairing.
*   Answer Call = Something to do with the middle button on the wire.

**LED**:

*   Powered on: Blue flash every 3 seconds.
*   Powering off: Single slow red pulse
*   Powering on: 3 blue flashes about once a second, followed by 1 quick blue flash.
*   Charging: When the LED turns from red to blue, it is fully charged.
