I'm revising my to-do process again.  My employer cancelled its full-time work-at-home program, so I need to use web-based tools, so I can get to them from work and home.

Some givens:

* I have 20-30 active projects ('cases') at work.  ("Projects" in the normal sense, not in the GTD sense.)
* Dropbox and Evernote are blocked by the firewall at work because work doesn't like "file sharing" sites.
* I have a tendency to carry items on my task list that I'm not really committed to completing.  (i.e. I'm over-committed.)

Primary tool: [Nirvana](https://app.nirvanahq.com/)

* Everything is sequential - unless manually Active Starred
* You don't have to put all your projects actions on the Next lists -- just the ones that you'll worry about, or you won't do without this reminder.
* Having a short list of actions to choose from helps ensure that you make progress on the important things that matter “right now.”
* Don't use Nirvana for tracking what I did.  Put that stuff elsewhere.  Nirvana is just for *doing*.


Weekly Review:

* Occurs Friday, Saturday, or Sunday afternoon.  If I don't get it done Friday or Saturday, Sunday's is a must-keep appointment.
* For each project, spend some time thinking about the project as a whole.  What is the project goal?  What is the project status? Is it moving forward?  What have we accomplished?  Review all sub-projects.
* Adjust technique to address what worries you most.  The goals are to get stuff off your mind and to work on the right things.
* Visit each task and ensure it complies with Task Urgency, Task Decomposition and Tags - documented elsewhere on thispage.
* Is the Someday list too long?  Do I need to add tags for undecided and not-doing?

Task Urgency:

* Star: Today.  Committed to work on this today and to stay up late if necessary.
* Next: This week. Consequential if I don't work on it this week.  (This week = through Monday after my next weekly review.)
* Later: Soon.  Not this week, but genuinely committed to get it done or expensive if not done.  Use a due date to drag it back to consciousness if appropriate.  (Due date = the date to consider moving it to Next, not the genuine deadline.)
* Someday: Maybe. Look at it again in a month.  Use a due date to drag it back to consciousness if appropriate.  (Due date = the date to consider moving it to Next, not the genuine deadline.)  

Task Decomposition:

* Sub-projects: Create a "task" under the project, and use Nirvana "inline checklist" for subproject tasks.  If I'm ready to work a checklist item, move it up a level (make it a task in the main proj).  [When do I mark it complete in the checklist?]
* Next-actions must be fully decomposed.

Tags:

* kpk (area)
* att (area - use this only for things that my employer wants, or things that impact my performance review or resume)
* rec (covers personal intrinsically enjoyable and work-don't-wanna-do-anything-productive)
* subproj (this item is a sub-project, contained within a parent project)
* Maybe use "undecided" and "not-doing" tags for Someday?

Stylish:

I used Stylish to

* Rename Later to Soon.
* Rename Someday to Maybe.
* Rename Focus to Today.
* Rename Next to This Week
