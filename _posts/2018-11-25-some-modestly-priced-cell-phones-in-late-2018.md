title: Some Modestly Priced Cell Phones in Late 2018

### General Notes

* Tom's Hardware says the average cell phone has 9:48 battery life, browsing via LTE at 150 nits of brightness.  150 is pretty dim.  Gizmodo says, "In most conditions, a 250 nit screen will appear plenty bright."
* I'm replacing my current phone because it frequently powers down due to low battery by surprise.
* I'd almost buy a Pixel 3 or a Pixel 3 XL, despite the high price, but they have sub-average battery life. If I'm buying a $700-$1000 phone (plus accessories), I need it to last at least 3 years and I'm not confident that battery will still be good.  And I might break it or lose it, or there could be some new whiz-bang feature I really want before 3 years are up.
* My existing Moto X2 phone has
    * 5.2 inch screen, 140.8 x 72.4 x 9.9 mm (5.5 x 2.9 x .4 inches), 1920 x 1080, 423 pixels per inch
    * 2 GB RAM
    * 32 GB storage, no SD Card support
    * Water repellent
    * Battery Life = 7:33 (tomshardware)
    * NFC
    * Bluetooth, WiFi, Cell Data
    * When it was new, Anandtech said its battery life was sub-average at 5 hours at 200 nits
    * Quick Charge, 3rd gen
* Things I'd like my phone to do/have
    * Still fit in my pocket
    * 64 GB storage or more (or 32 + SD Card)
    *  Battery last longer
    *  Rainproof
    *  GSM, LTE
    *  NFC (Android Pay)
    *  Bluetooth, WiFi, Cell Data
    *  Wireless charging
    *  Quick charge
    *  VoLTE, WiFi calling on AT&T
* Things I'm indifferent about
    * Fingerprint sensor.  Convenient, less secure, and police can compel you to unlock.
