I'm revisiting the eternal question of what-goes-where. I've made some recent changes, and I want to get them documented, to remind me of my textual data management plan.
  
  <br />
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>Tasks (to-do, Next Actions, etc.) go in my Outlook &quot;Tasks&quot; folder.</li>
    <li>GTD Projects go in Outlook in a folder (of content-type Task) named &quot;Projects&quot;.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The body of the project task-item contains actions that are not GTD Next Actions.
        
        <br /></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Input Jam web site gets how-to technical pointers of possible interest to others.
      
      <br /></li>
    <li>Evernote gets big-picture goals, miscellaneous strategy notes, how-did-I-do-this items that don't go to Input Jam.</li>
  </ul>For my Tasks, I have set up Outlook &quot;Search Folders&quot; for:
  
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>All Tasks</li>
    <li>Completed Tasks</li>
    <li>@Agenda</li>
    <li>@Errand</li>
    <li>@Everywhere (includes all contexts and no-context-filled-in tasks)</li>
    <li>@Home</li>
    <li>@Nowhere (tasks that don't have a context entered yet)</li>
    <li>@Office</li>
  </ul>Setting up a Search Folder for non-email items can't be done via the user interface in Outlook 2003, so I've written VBA (an Outlook macro) to create the Search Folders.
  
  <br />
  <br />My basic view in Outlook is the Shortcuts view (accessible via control-7), so that I can look at my Search Folders, my Inbox, my Tasks and my Projects folders, without other folders distracting me.
  
  <br />
  <br />I use some important keyboard shortcuts:
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>I use Slickrun, with control-space to bring-up Slickrun.&nbsp; Some of the Slickrun commands I use are:
      <br /></li>
    <ul>
      <li>do &lt;text&gt; -- create a Task in Outlook with &lt;text&gt;</li>
      <li>dop &lt;text&gt; -- just like 'do', except that it creates an item in my Projects Outlook folder.
        <br /></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Winkey-N - Starts Evernote
      <br /></li>
  </ul>
  <br />
