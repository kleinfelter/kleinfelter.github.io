Visio 2013 wants to make every connector line be an arrow.  I want plain lines.  You can't do this globally, but you can do it on a document-by-document basis.  Here's how to expedite it.

One time: Add a Quick Access Toolbar icon to make it easier to do every time you create a document.

* Files >> Options >> Quick Access Toolbar >> All Commands >> Define Styles

Then, each time you create a new document, click on the icon you just added, and tell Visio that you want no arrowhead on each end of your connector lines.
