I wanted to see the list of Amazon's new "Lending Library" books in a web browser, instead of on my Kindle.

This will do it, pretty close:
http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=&x=15&y=25#/ref=sr_nr_p_85_0?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_n_feature_browse-bin%3A618073011%2Cp_85%3A2470955011&bbn=283155&ie=UTF8&qid=1320366825&rnid=2470954011

It will also pick up Kindle books that have a special discount for Prime subscribers, even if that discount is not all the way to $0.

BTW - To return one of these books, visit "Manage Your Kindle" -> "Your Kindle Library".  This gets me there: https://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/fiona/manage?ie=UTF8&ref_=kinw_myk_surl_2&#Books
