  exist by virtue of deceit.  That's how they promulgate themselves; it is how they
  prosper. </i></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\nHey Rush, how's that Costa Rican Doctor thing

Here's a marvelous little quote from The Mighty Bombast himself, Rush Limbaugh:<p>

The Universe of Lies, the Universe of Reality, and The Four Corners of Deceit: Government, academia, science, and media.  Those institutions are now corrupt and exist by virtue of deceit.  That's how they promulgate themselves; it is how they prosper. </i></p>
