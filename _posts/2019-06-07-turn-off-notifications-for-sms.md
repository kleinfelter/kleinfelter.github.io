title: Turn Off Notifications for SMS From One Contact
---

I wanted to turn off notifications for text messages from some senders.  This has changed over the years.  Here's how it works on my phone today.  I think I'm on Android 8 (Oreo).


* Navigate to the list of conversations in Messages
* Open a thread with the desired sender
* Click the menu icon (3 dots)
* Choose Details
* Choose Notifications
* Turn off the "Show notifications" switch
