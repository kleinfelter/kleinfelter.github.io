title: Outlook 2016 Sending Empty Emails
---

My Outlook started sending empty emails.  The really annoying thing was that I could spend an hour composing the perfect email, hit Send, and it would strip the content before sending.  The email in the Sent folder was devoid of content too.  Gone!

I dunno if the following really fixed it, or if it simply went away on its own at the same time:

* File > Options > Mail > Compose messages in this format:
    * Set it to Rich Text
* Send an email.  It works!
* Set format back ot HTML.  It still works!
