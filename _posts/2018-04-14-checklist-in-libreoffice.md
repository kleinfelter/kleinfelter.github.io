title: Checklist in LibreOffice
layout: post

Sometimes I need an outline/bulleted list which looks like a checklist.  Here's how to create a checkbox bullet in LibreOffice (on the Mac).

* Create an ordinary bulleted list.   (Use the bullets tool on the toolbar.)
* Put the insertion point (i-beam cursor) at the beginning of the text of the line with the bullet you want to turn into a checkbox.
* Format > Bullets and Numbering > Options > Select... > Font = Wingdings
* I like the the first empty box in the list.  (End of the 5th row on my display.)  Character value Unicode F06F.
