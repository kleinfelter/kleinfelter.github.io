title: OS X Sidebar Missing Favorites
layout: post
---

The sidebar in my OS X el Capitan is missing my Faviorites, but just in file Open/Save dialogs, not in Finder.

There are published work-arounds.  Some of them result in having to recreate one's Favorites.  I don't like that.

What worked for me on September 27, 2017:

* Make a change to my Favorites on my Finder sidebar.  (Add/delete/move an item.)
* Reboot

I think you have to do both.  It might be enough to change Favorites and then restart Finder.
