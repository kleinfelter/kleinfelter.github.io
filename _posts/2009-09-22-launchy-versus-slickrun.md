Why I use Slickrun instead of Launchy
  <br />
  <br />Launchy is pretty, and aesthetics are important, but Slickrun carries command-line history with it.&nbsp; For example, if I have a macro named &quot;do&quot; and I enter &quot;do blah bleh floo&quot;, the next time I enter &quot;do &quot; it remembers &quot;blah bleh floo&quot;, where Launchy remembers only &quot;do&quot;.
  <br />
  <br />Slickrun uses about half the memory, but since that is only about 10 MB, that's not a major consideration.
  <br />
  <br />Slickrun doesn't have skins, and that's a plus because it means I don't fritter time looking at alternative skins.
