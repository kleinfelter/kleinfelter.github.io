I set up Google 2-factor authentication for some of my accounts.  Some useful pointers:

* Add another phone to the list Google will call: https://accounts.google.com/b/0/SmsAuthSettings#devices
* Assign a password for an app on a device: https://accounts.google.com/b/0/SmsAuthSettings#asps
* Show/edit computers that 2-factor authentication knows as yours: https://accounts.google.com/b/0/SmsAuthSettings#registered
* Print/display offline/backup 2-factor codes for when you don't have phone service: https://accounts.google.com/b/0/SmsAuthSettings#registered
