This is so twisted that I have to write it down to believe it works...
  <br />
  <br />I'm running GMail Mobile on my Blackberry 8700c, with a data plan, but not a <u>Blackberry Data Plan</u>.&nbsp; This means I don't get to use Blackberry push email.&nbsp; But I like the immediate notification of new mail that Blackberry email provides.&nbsp; I don't need it for all email, but I do need it for some.
  <br />
  <br />Easy, you say -- Just have GMail forward your email to your SMS.&nbsp; There is a problem with that approach:
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>Long emails get broken into multiple 160-byte SMS messages.&nbsp; I'm on AT&amp;T/Cingular, and I haven't found a way to tell them that my SMS should be truncated after the first 160 bytes.&nbsp; When someone sends me a couple of 16000-byte messages, there goes my 200 prepaid SMS, and they start whacking me for 20 cents per SMS.</li>
    <li>GMail insists on forwarding the entire message.&nbsp; I don't want to send the entire email. (See above.)
      <br /></li>
  </ul>So I started looking for email forwarding service that would truncate my messages, when it occurred to me that there is a famous service that truncates messages to SMS length -- Twitter.
  <br />
  <br />Hmmm... In order to post to Twitter via email, I could use Twittermail.&nbsp; But how to get my twits sent to my SMS?&nbsp; Twitter won't let me follow myself, soooo...&nbsp; I set up a second Twitter account and a second Twittermail account.
  <br />
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>I have a GMail filter that forwards messages from VIPs to Twittermail #2.</li>
    <li>Twittermail #2 sends them to Twitter account #2.</li>
    <li>Twitter account #1 &quot;follows&quot; Twitter account #2.</li>
    <li>Twitter account #1 sends twits to my Blackberry SMS.</li>
  </ol>It's actually even more complex.&nbsp; I have two Blackberrys (Blackberry1 and Blackberry2).&nbsp; I do have Blackberry Data Service on Blackberry2, but I don't want to carry it around.&nbsp; So Blackberry2 forwards all emails to GMail, where steps 1-4 above take over.
  <br />
  <br />Surprisingly, I actually get IM notification chirps from my Blackberry within a few seconds of the original email.&nbsp; (I suspect this mash-up is going to be fragile.)
  <br />
  <br />Idea to follow-up on: Could I send Twits to an IM client running on my Blackberry, with IM alerts, and avoid using up my SMS quota?
  <br />Idea2 to follow-up on: Could GMail forward to an IM server via an email to IM gateway, and then I could try an IM client running on my Blackberry, with IM alerts, and avoid using up my SMS quota?
