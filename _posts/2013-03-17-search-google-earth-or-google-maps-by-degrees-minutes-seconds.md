I usually use decimal degrees to specify a position in Google Earth (e.g. 30.12345, -83.45678).

Google Earth allows you to search using degrees/minutes/seconds notation too. Enter your coordinates with a space between each component (degrees/minutes/seconds), and a comma between
your latitude and longitude  (e.g. 30 12 34, -83 45 23). Remember to include the negative sign for western hemisphere.
