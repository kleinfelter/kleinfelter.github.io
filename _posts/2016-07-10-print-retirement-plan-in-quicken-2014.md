I've seen Quicken print a comprehensive report on your retirement plan, but I can't make it work now.

**This is NOT the way.  It just prints a single header.**

*    Select the Planning tab, just under the toolbar.
*    Select the Lifetime Planner sub-tab, under the Planning tab.
*    In the Event Status panel, click "Your retirement plan".  (Alternate: In the "Monthly Savings Targets" panel, select "Retirement contribution")
*    Quicken will open a new window titled "My Retirement Plan".
*    Click the Print icon in the upper-right corner of the My Retirement Plan window.

**You can see details on a single year:**

*   Select the Planning tab, just under the toolbar.
*   Select the Lifetime Planner sub-tab, under the Planning tab.
*   Double-click on the bar for a single year in the bar chart.
