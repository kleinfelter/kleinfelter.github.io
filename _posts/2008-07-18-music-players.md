<p>I'm taking a fresh look at iPod-enabled music players.&nbsp; Current candidates include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>iTunes </li>
    <li>Songbird + its iPod-enabling add-on </li>
    <li>Floola </li>
    <li>Yamipod </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Yeah, I'm Windows, so Mac-only and Linux-only players are out.&nbsp; I don't want to be further locking myself into Windows, so Windows-only players like Winamp are out.&nbsp; I'm not a glutton for punishment, so WINE+Linux doesn't count as being able to run a Windows-only player in Linux.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Songbird (reviewed 7/15/08)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>It is a workable media player.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Not portable by default.&nbsp; MIGHT be possible to run portably. </li>
      <li>With the iPod add-on, it accesses the iPod pretty well (without requiring the iTunes iPod driver).&nbsp; </li>
      <li>I can't seem to copy tunes from my iPod to a specified folder on my PC.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Has some interesting add-ons and skinning.&nbsp; I don't like the default skin (white text on black background).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Floola (reviewed 7/15/08)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>It is a workable media player.&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Portable.</li>
      <li>Copies files to PC with decent file naming options.</li>
      <li>Slow to exit.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Yamipod (reviewed 7/15/07)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>It is a workable media player.&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Portable. </li>
      <li>Copies files to PC with decent file naming options.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>I think I'll use Floola.&nbsp; From what I've read, Floola and Yamipod are both written by the same guy (they look a lot alike, including the readme.txt files), and he's paid more attention to Floola recently.</p>
