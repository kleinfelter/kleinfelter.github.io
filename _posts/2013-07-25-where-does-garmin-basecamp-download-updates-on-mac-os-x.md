I'm sorta obsessive about retaining a *local* copy of install files downloaded from the web.  This includes applications' auto-update files.  Just because the vendor says that the new version is later and greater, doesn't mean I'll agree.  Sometimes they delete features.  Sometimes they add onerous restrictions.

I want to retain each install file so that I can roll back to any prior version I've used.

When Garmin Basecamp auto-updates on a Mac, it downloads the .pkg (not a .dmg) to ~/Library/Caches/com.garmin.BaseCamp/SoftwareUpdates
