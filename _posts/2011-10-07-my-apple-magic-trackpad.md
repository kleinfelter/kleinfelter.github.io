I bought an Apple Magic Trackpad for use with my Windows PC.  I'd read that you can use the Bootcamp drivers to make it work.

It doesn't work well.
<p>
It is fine for a few minutes, then it flakes out, and then it is fine again.  "Flakes out" means that pointer movement becomes spastic, sometimes it moves only in one axis, etc.

So I thought I'd move it to my Ubuntu PC.  I'd read that Touchegg worked well.  I'm sure it does for some people, but I could either get my Trackpad to work or my keyboard, and I'm not ready to give up my keyboard.

I would up using it with my MacBook Pro!  Usually, I'm quite happy with my MacBook's keyboard and touchpad.  But when I'm one-hand browsing, I prefer to rest my forearm on the table and that causes the sharp edge of my MacBook to press on my wrist, which is uncomfortable.
<p>
Since the Magic Touchpad has a lower front edge, there's no sharp edge on my wrist.

Ironic, because I'd never have bought it for this purpose, but that's where it is most useful.
