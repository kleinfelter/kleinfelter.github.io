Using Circus Ponies Notebook v3.1.2, I want to clear all checkboxes in an outline.  How to do this is non-obvious.  Here's my procedure.  Note that this procedure has some steps which are not *always* required, but I'm trying to give a process that always works, with a minimum of "If you see x..." in it.

* If an "... Inspector" window is NOT visible:
    * Press Cmd-Shift-I
* Select the Cell Inspector pane of the Inspector window (the button with nested rectangles on it, on the left side of the Inspector's toolbar).
* Select the cell (the whole row) for any item in the outline which has a checkbox or a to-do.  Select just one item.  Check its checkbox, if it is unchecked.
* Press Cmd-A to select everything in the outline.
* Clear the "Completed" checkbox in the Inspector.
