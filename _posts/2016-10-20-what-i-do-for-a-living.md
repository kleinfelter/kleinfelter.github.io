I'm often asked, "What's your job?"  The short answer is that I fix things for AT&T.   The longer answer is:

For complex IT systems, involving load balancers, web servers, application servers, inter-application communication via sockets/web services/message queues, databases, SANs, proxy servers, security appliances:

* When everyone says, "My piece is good.  Somebody else is broken."
* I ensure that we collect evidence.
* I look at the evidence.
* I say, "The evidence shows that your piece is doing *this* and it should be doing *that*.  Fix it."
