I wanted my iTunes to synch (or 'sync' if you prefer) with my iPhone at 7:20 each morning.&nbsp; NPR updates its A.M. news podcast at 7:15, and I leave for work at 7:30.&nbsp; Since I take the subway, I can't listen to the news via radio, so I wanted to get my news via podcast.
  
  <br />
  <br />I couldn't find a way to do this without programming, so I wrote a little Windows program to start iTunes, and tell iTunes to start synchronizing.
  
  <br />
  <br />Source and executable are attached below.&nbsp; Note that it assumes you installed iTunes to C:\Program Files\iTunes.&nbsp; No warranty. Code placed in the public domain.
  
  <br />
  <br />Just create a Windows scheduled task to run this at the time of your choosing.
