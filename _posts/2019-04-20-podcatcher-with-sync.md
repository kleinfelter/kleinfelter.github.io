title: Podcatcher With Sync
layout: post
---

I wanted to use a podcast client which would sync across devices.  i.e. I could be playing a podcast on my phone while walking, pause it on my phone, resume it on my laptop, pause it on my laptop, and resume it on Alexa.

My other unusual usage pattern is that I sometimes listen while on my daily walk, but I mostly binge-listen while on occasional long trips (e.g. vacations).

I use Android, Mac, Windows, and occasionally Linux.

I'd been using Podcast Addict.  It doesn't work on Alexa or on the desktop.

Features I wanted to carry forward from  Podcast Addict:

* Auto-download of new episodes
* Auto-archive (hide and delete) played episodes
* The list of shows should indicate which shows have unplayed episodes (ideally with a count)
* Limit downloads to Wi-Fi
* Download of old, unplayed episodes (not just the latest episode)

I started by searching for multi-platform podcatchers, including platforms Android, IOS, and web/HTML5.  Alexa is a nice-to-have because I'm willing to use Bluetooth to stream from my phone.

Here's what I looked at:

* **Pocket Casts**- web $9, Android $4, IOS, Alexa.
    * Auto-downloads new episodes
    * Auto-archive of played episodes
    * List of shows indicates unplayed episodes
    * Can limit downloads to Wi-Fi
    * "Alexa, tell Pocket Casts to resume the last podcast". Slant likes it.
    * Web and desktop apps (Windows, Mac) missing some features present in Android.
* **Stitcher** - web, Android, IOS, Alexa.
    * Auto-downloads new episodes
    * No way to hide/delete played episodes.
    * List of shows does not indicate which have unplayed episodes.
    * "Alexa, ask Stitcher to pick up where I left off‚Äù
* **Podbean** - Android, IOS, HTML5. Alexa skill is reviewed horrible.
* **Castbox** - web, Android, IOS.  Alexa skill is reviewed horrible.
* **Player.FM** - web, Android, IOS. No Alexa.
* **Podcast Addict** - Android only
    * Has all the features I want except it is Android only.

I want:
- Desktop/web, Android. Able to continue a podcast from desktop/Android to Alexa.
- Auto-download via WiFi.
- Sync across platforms.
- hide/delete played episodes.
- List of shows displays which shows have unplayed episodes
- Download of old episodes (not just the latest episode)
