The automatic VMmare Tools install is convenient.  However, I needed to run Ubuntu 14 as a guest with an old version of VMware Player (because it is the standard, at my employer).  The old Player would not download a Tools that was newer than the Player.

The packages appear to be at https://packages.vmware.com/tools/esx/latest/index.html
