I tried using Taglocity 2.0.&nbsp; When it comes to <em>finding</em> data, Taglocity's ability to filter Outlook folders is great.&nbsp; All of the emails without the specified tag(s) simply vanish from the Outlook explorer (mail folder view).&nbsp; I really like being able to use all of the norrmal Outlook searching and sorting on results.&nbsp; This <em>much</em> nicer than working with search results from Windows Desktop Search, Google Desktop Search, or Lookout.

  <br />If I could just get someone to do all the tagging.&nbsp; I tagged almost all of my 8,000 emails over a weekend, and that went OK, but on-the-fly manual tagging just takes too much time and effort, and if I forget to tag an email, it is effectively lost.&nbsp; Their auto-tagging is nice, but it doesn't know what I consider to be the topic-keyword for the message.

  <br />Also, it insists on connecting to its server in order for the Outlook plug-in to work.&nbsp; What happens when Taglocity goes out of business or drops support for v2.0?
