| Description | Markup | Example 
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- 
| newline        | `\\`         |  
| exponent     | `^`          | \\( x^2 \\) 
| union           | `\cup`     | \\( \cup \\) 
| intersection | `\cap`     | \\( \cap \\)
| space          | `~` | 
| tilde             | '\sim' | \\( \sim \\)
| tilde             | `~` outside of TeX | `~`
| backslash             | `\backslash ` | \
| x over y (division) | `x \over y` | \\(x \over y \\)

My list focuses on things that work in mathematical formulae without using a package, because that's where I use TeX -- for math expressions.

#### Other web pages:

* [Handy LaTeX math reference](http://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols)
* [Render LaTeX](http://quicklatex.com/) but copy/paste will paste only a black rectangle.  Does an unattractive job on my complex example.
* [Render LaTeX](http://www.texrendr.com/) VERY SLOW - copy/paste of simple stuff as text works, but copy of image does not.  Renders my complex example well.
* [Render LaTeX](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/daum-equation-editor/dinfmiceliiomokeofbocegmacmagjhe/related) - Chrome plugin.  Renders well

For the copy/paste problem, you can work around it by saving the image to disk, opening with Paint, and copying from Paint.

Equation that is tough to render well:

` X(u) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n)e^{-i2\pi un/N} `

\\( X(u) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n)e^{-i2\pi un/N} \\)
