title: Why I'm Not Switching From Remember the Milk to "The Deadline"

I've been using <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">Remember the Milk</a> for awhile.  I noticed <a href="https://the-deadline.appspot.com/list">The Deadline</a>, and gave it a try.

I'm not what you'd call a hard-core Milk user, though I do have a paid subscription, in order to synchronize my iPhone with the web site frequently. I have a few <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">Getting Things Done</a> (GTD) contexts, and a large Someday/Maybe list.

Deadline looked interesting, because of their claims about AI and their 'virtual assistant.'  I'd also seen some talks by their head techie, and he seemed like a pretty smart guy.  What really interested me was that the app is an example of an HTML5, fully offline-enabled web site.  I wanted to see just how good an offline experience was available.

(Side note: I ran across The Deadline because they use <a href="http:/clojure.org">Clojure</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/">Closure</a>, and I've been learning a little Clojure and Closure.) 

I wanted to like Deadline, but here's why I went back to RTM:<ol>
<li>No ability to filter on tasks NOT tagged with a tag. (e.g. Show me all my tasks that are NOT tagged with "someday.")</li>
<li>Waiting while the app downloads an updated version of itself</li>
</ol>

Each of those is a pretty big deal for me.  

I use not-tagged-with a lot.  

The issue with downloading updated pages is more subtle.  Sometimes I use my phone where the signal is pretty weak.  The app picks up on the need to update quickly enough, but re-downloading updated pages/libraries can take some time.  When the "Oh, I need to capture this task" moment hits, the whole point of capturing it is to get it off my mind quickly.  That doesn't work if I have to wait.

The wait isn't ALWAYS a problem for me.  The big difference between a real smartphone app, and an offline-enabled HTML5 site, is that I get to choose when to update the app, but the site decides when I have to wait for updated HTML/JavaScript.

For some applications, that's not such a big deal, but for a to-do list, it's a problem.
