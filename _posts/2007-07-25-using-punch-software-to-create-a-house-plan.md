<p>Punch architecture software is a lot like democracy - it is the worst alternative, except for all the others we&#39;ve tried to date.</p><p>Here&#39;s how I created a house plan with Punch AS 4000 Version 10.</p><ol><li>Start Punch</li><li>File/New</li><li>Start Topo Designer (powertool)</li><li>Design/Lot Properties= 180x180. You want a multiple of 3 feet in order to match up with the grid Punch uses for landscape. This is NOT your lot size -- it is the size of your universe. Make it bigger than your lot; include the right-of-way plus a little of the surrounding world, unless you really want the edge of the Earth to be at the edge of your lot.  Don&#39;t make it too big, or it will slow down Punch.</li><li>Save the topography and exit the topo power tool.</li><li>Change to floor 1 (click the little house with a 1, 2, or a 3 in it, near the lower-left corner).</li><li>Select the exterior wall tool and draw the complete perimeter of the basement, including the foundation wall under the garage.  Draw each wall. You don&#39;t have to get the dimensions perfect. Just make sure you enclose the entire foundation.  Don&#39;t use exterior walls other than for perimeter walls.<br /></li></ol>
