My garage door opener stopped working.  After experimenting a bit, I discovered that it worked only when a remote was VERY near (e.g. within 6 inches of the antenna).<br>
I replaced the battery, tried a different remote, power-cycled the opener.  No joy.<br>
But then one day, I happened to press a button on the remote when it was inside my house, at the other end from the garage, and the door opened.  Very strange.<br>
I checked Google, and there are plenty of people with the problem, and they tend to blame RF (radio) interference or a disconnected antenna wire.<br>
I got up on a ladder, to inspect the antenna connection to the logic board.  To open the cover, I had to remove the light bulb.  The LED bulb. The RF noisy LED bulb.<br>
The new LED bulb was the source of the problem.  I didn't notice it right away because the opener worked so long as the light was off.

Before you replace your Craftsman/Chaimberlain garage door opener because the remotes stopped working, try unscrewing the LED light bulbs.
