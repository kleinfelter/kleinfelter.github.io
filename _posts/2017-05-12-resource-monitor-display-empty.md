title: Resource Monitor Window Is Empty
---
The Resource Monitor window is empty.  You could say it is transparent.  There is a title bar and a frame, but the main window body is empty/transparent.

It turns out that Resource Monitor does not work with the Windows Classic theme.  It only works with an "Aero" theme enabled.  Yuck!

Impacts Windows 7, and possibly others.
