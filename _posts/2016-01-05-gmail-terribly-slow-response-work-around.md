Sometimes I get epically slow response from GMail.  I'm running GMail in a Chrome tab on a late model Macbook.  Sometimes it takes 15 seconds to echo a keystroke or to respond to a mouse click.

* Refreshing the page appears to cure the issue for a while.  Then it comes back.
* At the same time as one tab on one GMail account has this latency, another Chrome tab on a different email account works just fine.  I've observed latency on my @gmail.com account.  I'm not sure whether I've seen it on my Google Apps email account.
* I tried disabling AdBlock on that page.  We'll see if it helps.  I can't tell without a soak period because disabling AdBlock does a page refresh, and doing a page refresh temporarily cures the problem.
