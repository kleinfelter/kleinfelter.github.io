title: Too Much "Security"
---

Today, I wanted to download my financial accounts into Quicken.  I entered my password to login to my Macbook.  (My Macbook disk is encrypted, so all passwords after this point are silly.)

*  I booted my Windows VM.  That Windows has a password, but Windows is willing to remember it.
*  I launched Quicken and it demanded a Quicken account password, 'for you security.'
*  I launched my password wallet and it demanded a password.
*  I clicked the button in Quicken to download data, and it demanded the password for my password wallet.

This is not security. This is idiocy.
