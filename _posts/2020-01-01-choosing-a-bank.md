title: Choosing a Bank
---

I recently had occasion to take a close look at my bank.  Nothing *wrong* with my bank per se, but I chose it about 30 years ago and my situation (and banking) has changed over the years.

#### I want:

* "High interest savings" - I'm going to put 3-6 months in an FDIC insured account in case there's a major market melt-down.  This covers everything except government melt-down.
* Checking - I want my checking and savings at the same bank for easy inter-account shuffling.
* Another free checking account *elsewhere* in case my main bank gets frozen.  I'll send my ACH debits and P2P e-transfers through here.
* Free "Bill Pay".

#### Candidates:

There are many good banks. I'm focusing on:

* Alliant
* Ally
* Discover

These are all highly-rated by consumer reports and Reddit seems positive about them.  There are others, but I want:

* Full range of services
* Among the higher savings rates
* Among the higher customer satisfaction
* Very good web site

"Very good" in all of these -- not necessarily the best in any one category.
