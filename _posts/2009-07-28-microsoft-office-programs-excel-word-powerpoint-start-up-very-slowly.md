I was running into a problem where Microsoft Office programs, such as Excel, Word, and PowerPoint were taking &quot;too long&quot; to start and show an empty document.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  <br />After I determined that there was plenty of memory and CPU available, and defragmented my drive, they were still slow to start.
  <br />
  <br />It turns out they were attempting to connect to a printer that wasn't there.&nbsp; I have a laptop, and (surprise, surprise) I use it in different locations.&nbsp; When the Windows default printer isn't attached, Office programs try to do something to it on start-up, and they have to wait until it times out.
  <br />
  <br />The solution: Set the Windows default printer to a PDF virtual printer.&nbsp; It is always available.
