These are the companion 'helper' apps for my [Chrome Extension Auto-update Disabler Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extension-update-disabler/pfijgddffdeabjfpkfikmkfdpaleebek).

Chrome automatically updates your extensions. There have been occasions where an extension developer has lost/sold control of his extension to a malware author. Or maybe you just want to control when updates hit your system. The Extension Update Disabler extension empowers your to enable/disable automatic updates of your Chrome extensions.

BY DOWNLOADING THESE APPLICATIONS YOU AGREE TO HOLD ME HARMLESS FOR ANY UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES!

* [Mac Installer](/_downloads/chrome-extension-autoupdate-disabler/installer.sh)
* [Windows Installer](https://github.com/kleinfelter/chrome-autoupdate-disabler/releases/download/0.0.3/setup.exe)

Installing:

* For the Windows installer, just download setup.exe and run it.
* for the Mac installer, download installer.sh, open a Terminal window and run "bash installer.sh".

Note: If you use this extension, it becomes your responsibility to ensure that security updates get installed on your system to prevent breaches.

The extension requires you to install a separate 'helper' application from this page because Chrome does not allow extensions to alter the auto-update behavior of other extensions 
directly, so you install a separate executable 'helper' app on your local system, and that helper app updates your extensions to be unable to auto-update themselves. 

If you install new extensions after disabling auto-updates, those new extensions will be ENABLED. (That's how they got installed.) Disabling extensions just marks currently installed extensions disabled -- it does not monitor for newly installed extensions. If you want new extentions to be disabled, you must come here and disable auto-update after installing them.
